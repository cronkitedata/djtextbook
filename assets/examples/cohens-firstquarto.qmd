## About me

Here are three things you might not know about me:

-   I saw the **Talking Heads** playing *Pscho Killer* at CBGB's in New York. (The drinking age was 18 at the time)
-   Before I came to Cronkite, I'd never lived further west than Western New York.
-   I went to school at UNC but at taught at Duke. Which one has my loyalty?

## Some R Code

To add some code, we have to add a code chunk.

```{r}

my_cool_number <- 5 

my_cool_number



```

```{r}

my_name <- "Sarah"



```

This is a new code chunk

```{r}

our_names <- c("Sarah", "Mike", "Jacquee", "Maud")

our_names

```
