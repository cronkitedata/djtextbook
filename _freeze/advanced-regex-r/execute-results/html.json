Instead of a direct operator, such as `mycolumn < 100` , the are implemented in functions. \n\nWe've already looked at the function `str_like()`, which allows for upper or lower case with wild cards. This chapter, however, use the regular expressions that were described in the last section. \n\n## Resouces for using regular expressions in R\n\n* The [tidyverse cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/strings.pdf) on the package `stringr` (which is party of tidyverse) has the outlines of each function that uses these regular expression. It's a little hard to read, but has all of the shortcuts on the second page.  Look at the part that says, \"type this\", which translates to \"to mean this\" as in Regex101. \n\n\n* Nathan Collins, a student in the 2022 MAIJ cohort, [did an explainer on using `str_detect()` on the ACLED])(https://npcdata.github.io/projects/collins_explainer.html) data that many of you are using for your projects \n\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-important\n\nIn R, regular expressions are a little different than in the Python and other languages listed in [regex101](https://regex101.com) . \n\n* The expressions are still case sensitive! In real life, it's often easier to use a combination of functions, first to turn the column into lower case, and then to use the regular expression on that. It's much easier than trying to match which case it is. \n\n* Instead of one `\\` backslash (`\\`), there are two (`\\\\`) to \"escape\" special characters like parentheses or to use a special type of character such as a digit. \n\n::: \n\n\n## Sample data\n\nFor this example, we'll use a small set of Tweets from Donald Trump, representing the last few months he was on on the platform. It runs from Nov. 1, 2020 to Jan. 8, 2021, when Twitter banned him. Retweets were removed, but there are a number of tweets that are just links to other content. \n\n\nHere is a random sample of the 1,112 tweets: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-screen-right}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-e2cb416ebb279b92fc58\" class=\"reactable html-widget \" style=\"width:auto;height:750px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-e2cb416ebb279b92fc58\">{\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"tweet_date\":[\"2020-12-02T20:56:29Z\",\"2020-11-23T04:57:13Z\",\"2020-11-21T23:13:41Z\",\"2020-11-12T15:16:02Z\",\"2020-12-03T01:07:42Z\",\"2020-11-04T05:49:04Z\",\"2021-01-01T20:34:14Z\",\"2020-12-21T15:30:09Z\",\"2020-11-15T04:51:46Z\",\"2020-12-25T13:32:32Z\",\"2020-12-06T05:55:57Z\",\"2020-12-26T23:23:36Z\",\"2020-12-05T03:05:35Z\",\"2020-12-12T05:46:39Z\",\"2020-12-08T14:36:34Z\",\"2020-11-25T00:26:35Z\",\"2020-12-24T20:56:47Z\",\"2020-12-08T01:05:27Z\",\"2020-12-06T06:02:36Z\",\"2020-12-11T00:39:27Z\",\"2020-11-14T21:24:15Z\",\"2020-11-02T04:22:47Z\",\"2021-01-03T13:14:10Z\",\"2020-11-02T19:22:20Z\",\"2020-12-13T22:15:23Z\",\"2020-12-01T13:48:19Z\",\"2020-11-21T22:48:57Z\",\"2020-11-01T13:54:29Z\",\"2020-12-30T19:05:45Z\",\"2020-12-10T15:12:32Z\",\"2020-12-02T23:32:27Z\",\"2020-11-07T21:53:34Z\",\"2020-12-23T00:15:31Z\",\"2020-11-18T02:22:04Z\",\"2020-12-12T04:37:08Z\",\"2020-12-09T13:39:36Z\",\"2020-11-14T15:44:19Z\",\"2020-12-06T02:22:55Z\",\"2020-12-19T19:19:18Z\",\"2020-11-07T15:36:36Z\",\"2020-11-27T15:56:13Z\",\"2020-11-11T19:53:51Z\",\"2020-11-26T00:01:20Z\",\"2020-12-17T14:56:14Z\",\"2020-12-13T22:49:39Z\",\"2020-12-03T20:50:04Z\",\"2021-01-05T03:55:39Z\",\"2020-11-03T03:37:14Z\",\"2020-11-12T14:26:29Z\",\"2020-11-14T20:07:56Z\",\"2020-11-05T15:09:19Z\",\"2020-12-12T05:24:13Z\",\"2020-12-15T15:41:41Z\",\"2020-11-18T14:54:23Z\",\"2020-11-15T04:43:19Z\",\"2020-12-30T15:45:30Z\",\"2020-12-22T15:29:24Z\",\"2020-12-20T05:04:09Z\",\"2020-11-01T15:16:25Z\",\"2020-11-03T00:33:09Z\",\"2020-12-01T13:56:21Z\",\"2020-12-04T23:23:53Z\",\"2020-12-08T19:00:24Z\",\"2020-12-19T19:09:51Z\",\"2020-11-03T07:30:20Z\",\"2020-11-10T13:01:15Z\",\"2020-11-16T04:55:48Z\",\"2020-12-21T12:24:59Z\",\"2021-01-05T03:40:18Z\",\"2020-11-22T16:59:28Z\",\"2020-12-05T02:43:00Z\",\"2020-12-31T01:13:12Z\",\"2020-12-16T06:09:36Z\",\"2020-11-09T04:34:36Z\",\"2020-11-05T14:12:37Z\",\"2020-11-01T11:49:36Z\",\"2020-11-22T13:13:32Z\",\"2021-01-06T13:22:26Z\",\"2020-12-18T12:58:55Z\",\"2020-11-16T14:04:50Z\",\"2020-11-28T20:49:26Z\",\"2020-12-05T22:33:32Z\",\"2020-11-03T14:04:57Z\",\"2020-12-10T16:09:53Z\",\"2020-11-02T18:22:15Z\",\"2020-11-02T15:17:43Z\",\"2020-11-25T21:08:07Z\",\"2020-11-06T02:38:01Z\",\"2020-11-12T04:17:21Z\",\"2020-11-18T13:55:05Z\",\"2020-12-20T04:39:05Z\",\"2020-12-06T05:49:58Z\",\"2021-01-03T05:09:46Z\",\"2020-11-03T03:45:50Z\",\"2020-12-03T19:01:39Z\",\"2020-12-01T18:51:50Z\",\"2020-11-16T15:29:34Z\",\"2020-11-20T13:53:00Z\",\"2021-01-02T22:45:50Z\",\"2020-12-02T16:09:32Z\"],\"text\":[\"Statement by Donald J.

It includes wild cards, so it could just return the whole phrase. \n* `str_match(col_name, expression)` is more complicated - it lets you use pieces of the expression, but it returns a list, which is hard to work with. We'll skip that for now. \n\n\n\nSome other useful string functions are: \n\n* **To convert the case**, use str_to_lower(colname), str_to_upper(colname), or str_to_title()  \n* **To smush together phrases**, use str_c() or paste() or paste0. \n\n\n### Convert everything to lowercase\n\nOne strategy for using regular expressions is to convert everything to lower case before trying to match text. In R, the regular expression is, by default, case-sensitive and it's difficult to predict how it might show up in free text like this. ^[Yes, we might care about the case, isolating places where Trump uses all-caps.

Here's one way to find a lot of them: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two or or three parts to a regular expression:   \n\n1. The pattern you are trying to find.\n2. An optional replacement, which could use part of what you've found in the original seeking phase.\n3. Options - the big one in R is `negate=TRUE`, which means to match everything EXCEPT what is found.\n\nIn practice, you'll usually save the pieces of each pattern you've found into a variable, then put them back together differently.\n\nHere are two other good tutorials on regular expressions: \n\n* [From Justin Meyer](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/meyer_regex.pdf) at a recent IRE conference that can serve as a guide.  \n* [From Prof. Christian McDonald of UT-Austin](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/regex_for_rest_of_us.pdf)\n\n* If you're using R, you can use a regex using the `stringr` package (part of the tidyverse) using the functions *str_detect* , *str_extract* and their cousins. They look like this:  \n\n```markdown\n    str_detect(var_name, regex(\"pattern\")) \n````\n\n* The [vignette on the `stringr` package](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) in the Tidyverse is reasonably helpful. \n\n## Types of regular expression patterns\n\n### Literal strings\n\nThese are just letters, like \"abc\" or \"Mary\". They are case-sensitive and no different than using text in a filter.\n\nYou can tell the regex that you want to find your pattern at the beginning or end of a line:\n\n```markdown\n  ^   = \"Find only at the beginning of a line\"\n  $   = \"Find only at the end of a line\"\n```\n\n### Wild cards\n\nA wild card is a character you use to indicate the word \"anything\". Here are some ways to use wild cards in regex:\n\n```markdown\n    .      = \"any single character of any type\"\n    .?     = \"a possible single character of any type (but it might not exist)\"\n    .*     = \"anything or nothing of any length\"\n    .+     = \"anything one or more times\"\n    .{1,3} = \"anything running between 1 and 3 characters long\"\n```\n\nRegular expressions also have wild cards of specific types. In R, they are \"escaped\" using two backslashes. In other languages and in the example <https://regex101.com> site they only use one backslash:\n\n```markdown\n      \\\\d   = \"Any digit\"\n      \\\\w   = \"Any word character\"\n      \\\\s   = \"Any whitespace (tab, space, etc.)\"\n      \\\\b   = \"Any word boundary\" (period, comma, space, etc.)\n```\n\nWhen you upper-case them, it's the opposite:\n\n```markdown\n      \\\\D = \"Anything but a digit\"\n```\n### Character classes\n\nSometimes you want to tell the regex what characters it is allowed to accept. For example, say you don't know whether there is an alternative spelling for a name -- you can tell the regex to either ignore a character, or take one of several.\n\nIn R, we saw that there were alternative spellings for words like \"summarize\" -- the British and the American spellings. You could, for example, use this pattern to pick up either spelling:\n\n```markdown\n        summari[sz]e\n```\n\nThe bracket tells the regex that it's allowed to take either one of those characters. You can also use ranges:\n\n      [a-zA-Z0-9]\n\nmeans that any lower case, upper case or numeric character is allowed.\n\n### Escaping\n\nBecause they're already being used for special purposes, some characters have to be \"escaped\" before you can search for them. Notably, they are parentheses (), periods, backslashes, dollar signs, question marks, dashes and carets.\n\nThis means that to find a period or question mark, you have to use the pattern\n\n        \\\\. or\n        \\\\?\n\nIn the Regex101, this is the biggest difference among the flavors of regex -- Python generally requires the least amount of escaping.\n\n### Match groups\n\nUse parentheses within a pattern to pick out pieces, which you can then use over again. The end of this chapter shows how to do this in R, which is a little complicated because we haven't done much with `lists`. \n\n\n## Sample data\n\nHere are three small text files that you can copy and paste from your browser into the [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) site. It's a site that lets you test out regular expressions, while explaining to you what's happening with them.\n\n1. A [list of phone numbers](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/csv/regex_phones.txt) in different formats\n2. A [list of dates](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/csv/regex_dates.txt) that you need to convert into a different form.\n3. A [list of addresses](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/csv/regex_addresses.txt) that are in multiple lines, and you need to pull out the pieces. (Courtesy of IRE)\n4. A [small chunk of the H2B visa applications](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/csv/regex_h2bvisas.txt) from Arizona companies or worksites that has been kind of messed up for this demonstration, in tab-delimited format.\n\n## Testing and examining patterns with Regex101 \n\n[Regex 101](https://regex101.com) is a website that lets you copy part of your data into a box, then test different patterns to see how they get applied. Regular expressions are very difficult to write and to read, but Regex101 lets you do it a little piece at a time. Just remember that every time you use '\\' in regex101, you will need '\\\\` in R. \n\n### Looking for specific words or characters\n\nThe easiest regex is one that has just the characters  you're looking for when you know that they are the right case. They're called *literals* because you are literally looking for those letters or characters.\n\n![](assets/images/advanced-regex1.png){width=100%}\n\n## Practice #1: Extract date parts\n\nIn Regex 101, change the \"Flavor\" to \"Python\" -- otherwise, you have to escape more of the characters.^[Each language implements regular expressions slightly differently -- when you begin to learn more languages, this will be one of the first things you'll need to look up.]\n\nWe want to turn dates that look like this:\n\n      1/24/2018\n\ninto something that looks like this:\n\n     2008-1-24\n\nCopy and paste these numbers into the regex 101 window:\n\n    9/7/2017\n    9/11/1998\n    9/11/2017\n    9/19/2018\n    9/15/2017\n    10/13/2019\n    11/3/2017\n\nFirst, you can use any digit using the pattern \"\\d\". Try to do it in pieces. First, see if you can find one or two digits at the beginning of the line.\n\n      ^\\d{1,2}\n\nTry coming up with the rest of it on your own before you type in the answer:\n\n      ^\\d{1,2}.\\d{1,2}.\\d{4}\n\n(This works because regular expressions normally are \"greedy\". That is, if you tell it \"one or two digits\", it will always take two if they exist.)\n\nPut parentheses around any pieces that you want to use for later:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](assets/images/advanced-regex4.png){width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow each piece has its section, numbered 0 for the whole match, and then 1-3 for the pieces.\n\n![](assets/images/advanced-regex3.png){width=100%}\n\n## Practice #2: Extract pieces of phone numbers\n\nHere are some phone numbers in different formats:\n\n```markdown\n    623-374-1167\n    760.352.5212\n    831-676-3833\n    (831)-676-3833\n    623-374-1167 ext 203\n    831-775-0370\n    (602)-955-0222  x20\n    928-627-8080\n    831-784-1453\n```\n\nThis is a little more complicated than it looks, so try piecing together what this one says:\n\n```markdown\n      (\\d{3})[-.\\)]+(\\d{3})[-.]+(\\d{4})\n```\n\n(This won't work in the \"substitute\" area -- it would be easier to create a new variable with the results than to replace the originals.)\n\nAnything within parentheses will be \"captured\" in a block.\n\n## Practice #3: Extract address pieces\n\nHere are a few lines of the data from [Prof. McDonald's tutorial](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/regex_for_rest_of_us.pdf), which you can copy and paste to go his exercise. (He uses the Javascript version of regular expressions, but for our purposes in this exercise, it doesn't matter which one you use. If you choose Python,  you'll have one extra step, of putting a slash (\\) before the quotes. The colors work a little better if you leave it on the default PHP method.)\n\n```markdown\n    \"10111 N LAMAR BLVD\n    AUSTIN, TX 78753\n    (30.370945933000485, -97.6925542359997)\"\n    \"3636 N FM 620 RD\n    AUSTIN, TX 78734\n    (30.377873241000486, -97.9523496219997)\"\n    \"9919 SERVICE AVE\n    AUSTIN, TX 78743\n    (30.205028616000448, -97.6625588019997)\"\n    \"10601 N LAMAR BLVD\n    AUSTIN, TX 78753\n    (30.37476574700048, -97.6903937089997)\"\n    \"801 E WILLIAM CANNON DR Unit 205\n    AUSTIN, TX 78745\n    (30.190914575000477, -97.77193838799968)\"\n    \"4408 LONG CHAMP DR\n    AUSTIN, TX 78746\n    (30.340981111000474, -97.7983147919997)\"\n    \"625 W BEN WHITE BLVD EB\n    AUSTIN, TX 78745\n    (30.206884239000487, -97.7956469989997)\"\n    \"3914 N LAMAR BLVD\n    AUSTIN, TX 78756\n    (30.307477098000447, -97.74169675199965)\"\n    \"15201 FALCON HEAD BLVD\n    BEE CAVE, TX 78738\n    (30.32068282700044, -97.96890311999965)\"\n    \"11905 FM 2244 RD Unit 100\n    BEE CAVE, TX 78738\n    (30.308363203000454, -97.92393357799966)\"\n    \"3801 JUNIPER TRCE\n    BEE CAVE, TX 78738\n    (30.308247975000484, -97.93511531999968)\"\n    \"12800 GALLERIA CIR Unit 101\n    BEE CAVE, TX 78738\n    (30.307996778000472, -97.94065088199966)\"\n    \"12400 W SH 71 Unit 510\n    BEE CAVE, TX 78733\n    (30.330682136000462, -97.86979886299969)\"\n    \"716 W 6TH ST\n    AUSTIN, TX 78701\n    (30.27019732500048, -97.75036306299967)\"\n    \"3003 BEE CAVES RD\n    ROLLINGWOOD, TX 78746\n    (30.271592738000436, -97.79583786499967)\"\n```\n\n## On your own\n\n[This is a small list of H2A visa applications](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/csv/regex_h2bvisas.txt), which are requests for agricultural and seasonal workers, from companies or worksites in Arizona.
