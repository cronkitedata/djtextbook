    "text": "Preface\nThis book serves as a compilation of of handouts, websites and tutorials that I have created in my data reporting class at ASU’s Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, IRE and NICAR conferences, and as an adjunct at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Some of the material will be useful in other courses or for self-study, but it is primarily aimed at the investigative journalism masters’ students at Cronkite.\nIt covers:\n\nReporting and replication in data journalism\nAnalyzing data for stories using R and R Markdown\nFinding and creating data for stories\n\nIt doesn’t cover:\n\nData visualization for publication\nWorking with non-tabular data such as images, sound or document collections\nCreating news applications\nFreedom of Information and public records techniques\nData science. This is a journalism book, not a programming or statistics book.\n\n\nNavigation\nEach major section on the left can be expanded to see the chapters included. The search box above the navigation index is best used to find sections and headings rather than phrases. Skip to sections of the current chapter using the menu on the right.\n\n\nR or Python?\nIf you ask a data scientist or technologist which language you should learn first, you’ll start a heated debate between advocates of R, Python, Javascript , SQL, Julia and others. Ask the same question of a data journalist and the answer will be: “Choose one that is free and that your colleagues use so you can get help.” For our purposes, it really doesn’t matter – any of the standard languages will do.\nMy only rule is that you stick to your first language for a little while before trying a new one. It would be like trying to learn Portuguese and Spanish at the same time, when you know neither one to begin with. They’re related, but very different.\nMost employers won’t care which programming language you know because it’s relatively easy to learn another once you’re comfortable with the concepts and good data journalism habits. In a few cases, such as the Associated Press, R is preferred. In others, like the Los Angeles Times, it’s a little easier to work with the team if you work in Python. Visualization teams work primarily in Javascript. But they’ll mainly just be happy that you are reasonably self-sufficient in any language.\nI chose R because I find it a little easier to use when trying to puzzle something out step by step, and it is particularly good at working with the weird and varied forms of data thrown at us, but it’s really just a matter of taste and comfort.\nThat said, this book is oriented toward the “tidyverse”, which comprises a whole host of methods that are designed to work together using common syntax and concepts. There are many other ways to do almost everything presented in this book, which we won’t cover."

It will pay off handsomely if you have to piece together what the code is doing and if you have to learn to read the error messages.\n\n\n\nChanges from previous years\nPreviously, the conceptual and story examples were scattered throughout tutorials. This made it hard for students to know what they had to do – read the concepts or go through the tutorials? They tended to skip the more journalistic portions of the text. This year, I’ve split them out and interleaved those chapters where they made sense (at least to me).\n“In this chapter:” sections were removed. No one seemed to pay attention to it, and the section just made each chapter that much longer. Instead, I’ve moved the “On this page” section to the right, making each page a little narrower but making in-chapter navigation easier."

I’ve also removed the math chapter, under the idea that anyone taking this class understands the need for basic arithmetic and statistics. Both of these sections are still available in the appendices.\nSome chapters were updated with new, useful versions of functions, but others were left using the more traditional methods.

    "section": "1.1 Story development",
    "text": "1.1 Story development\nIn data journalism, we often start with a tip, or a hypothesis. Sometimes it’s a simple question. Walt Bogdanich of The New York Times is renowned for seeing stories around every corner. Bogdanich has said that the prize-winning story “A Disability Epidemic Among a Railroad’s Retirees” came from a simple question he had when railway workers went on strike over pension benefits – how much were they worth? The story led to an FBI investigation and arrests, along with pension reform at the largest commuter rail in the country.1\nSometimes, the hypothesis might be more formal.\n\nIn 2021, the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at ASU published “Little victims everywhere”, a set of stories on the lack of justice for survivors of child sexual assault on Native American reservations.\nThat story came after previous reporters for the center analyzed data from the Justice Department showing that the FBI dropped most of the cases it investigated, and the Justice Department then only prosecuted about half of the matters referred to it by investigators. The hypothesis was that they were rarely pursued because federal prosecutors – usually focused on immigration, white collar crime and drugs – weren’t as prepared to pursue violent crime in Indian Country.\nWhen studying a data-driven investigation, try to imagine what the reporters were trying to prove or disprove, and what they used to do it. In journalism, we rely on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. It’s not enough to prove the “numbers” or have the statistical evidence. That is just the beginning of the story. We are supposed to ground-truth them with the stories of actual people and places.\n\nCompared to what?\nInvestigative stories are based on the idea that something is happening that shouldn’t. This suggests that the journalists can tell the difference between a “good” and “bad” outcome. You should look for that comparison in stories.\nThese reporters often look for a legal or regulatory standard, such as the number of violations allowed before shutting down a restaurant, to define their comparisons. Sometimes it’s a standard that lawmakers make for themselves by promising results from a program or law. Sometimes they can find industry standards, such as licensing rules for professionals. But you might end up comparing your area to others, or today versus yesterday.\nAt the New York Times, in a story on the problem of police-involved domestic violence, we struggled to find the right “compared to what?” Statistics wouldn’t help, since they might have come from police departments ignoring the problem. Instead, we found procedures recommended by a police chiefs’ association that defined best practices, and used them to compare the behavior of the largest departments in the U.S. We also compared disciplinary actions for domestic violence against other violations, such as testing positive for marijuana or stealing from the precinct.\nWhen you read an investigative story, be sure to watch for any comparisons. There’s no point in publishing an investigation if it didn’t find something newsworthy. No trend or number is newsworthy on its own – only in context or in comparison with something else."

    "section": "1.2 Go beyond the numbers",
    "text": "1.2 Go beyond the numbers\nIt’s easy to focus on the numbers or statistics that make up the key findings, or the reason for the story. Some reporters make the mistake of thinking all of the numbers came from the same place – a rarity in most long-form investigations. Instead, the sources have been woven together and are a mix of original research and research done by others. Try to pay attention to any sourcing done in the piece. Sometimes, it will tell you that the analysis was original. Other times it’s more subtle.\nBut don’t just look at the statistics being reported in the story. In many (most?) investigations, some of the key people, places or time elements come directly from a database.\nWhen I was analyzing some housing court data for The New York Times, one fact hit me as I was looking at a timeline of eviction cases: The most cases ever filed in one of the city’s courts happened during a Thanksgiving week one year. It was the kind of detail that could have been compelling in a story if it had been more recent. But other anecdotes led directly to lines of reporting in the story. One was the profile of a process server who filed court papers claiming to have delivered six eviction notices in 12 minutes, seemingly acquiring “some of the salient skills of a mountain goat”.2\nOften, the place that a reporter visits is determined by examples found in data. In this story on rural development funds, all of the examples came from an analysis of the database. Once the data gave us a good lead, we examined press releases and other easy-to-get sources before calling and visiting the recipients or towns."

For now, try to answer these questions about an investigative story as you read it.\n\nWhere might the reporters have found their key examples, and what made them good characters or illustrations of the larger issue? Could they have come from the data?\nWhat do you think came first – a narrative single example that was broadened by data , or a big idea that was illustrated with characters ?\nWhat records were used? Were they public records, leaks, or proprietary data?\nWhat methods did they use? Did they do their own testing, use statistical analysis, or geographic methods? You won’t always know, but look for a methodology section or a description alongside each story.\nWhat is their comparison? Nothing is newsworthy unless it’s compared to something that isn’t. What’s that something?\nHow might you localize or adapt these methods to find your own stories?\nPick out the key findings (usually in the nut graf or in a series of bullets after the opening chapter): are they controvesial? How might they have been derived? What might have been the investigative hypothesis?\nDid the story give critics their due and how did reporters try to falsify their own work?\nHow effective is the writing and presentation of the story? What makes it compelling journalism rather than a dry study? How might you have done it differently? Is a video story better told in text, or would a text story have made a good documentary? Are the visual elements well integrated? Does the writing draw you in and keep you reading? Think about structure, story length, entry points and graphics all working together.\nAre you convinced? Are there holes or questions that didn’t get addressed?"

This list of potential newsworthy data points is adapted from Paul Bradshaw’s “Data Journalism Heist”.\n\nCompare the claims of powerful people and institutions against facts – the classic investigative approach.\nReport on unexpected highs and lows (of change, or of some other characteristic)\nLook for outliers – individual values that buck a trend seen in the rest\nVerify or bust some myths\nFind signs of distress, happiness or dishonesty or any other emotion.\nUncover new or under-reported long-term trends.\nFind data suggesting your area is the same or different than most others of its kind.\n\nBradshaw also did a recent study of data journalism pieces: “Here are the angles journalists use most often to tell the stories in data”, in Online Journalism Blog. I’m not sure I agree, only because he’s looking mainly at visualizations rather than stories, but they’re worth considering."

If your data is local, you might look for a story that used similar data elsewhere, such as 911 response times or overdose deaths. But many stories use federal datasets that can easily be localized.

Their purpose is to make sure they know how to request it from a government agency. The same idea applies to using data that we acquire elsewhere.\nAs reporters, we usually deal with data that was created in the process of doing something else – conducting an inspection or paying a parking ticket. These adminsitrative datasets are created in government as part of carrying out their work. They form the basis of much investigative reporting and they are often the subject of public records and FOIA requests. They were born as part of the government doing its job, without any thought given to how it might be used in another way. In the sciences, those are often called “administrative records”.\nAnother type of data might be considered “digital trace” data, which often refers to social media posts, online publications and other items that are born in electronic form and posted publicly for anyone to view and use.\nFinally, there are datasets that are compiled or collected specifically for the purpose of studying something. They might be collected in the form of a survey or a poll, or they might be monitoring systems such as pollution or weather stations. In this instance, the information has intrinsic value AS information."

    "section": "2.2 Granular and aggregated data",
    "text": "2.2 Granular and aggregated data\nOne of the hardest concepts for a lot of new data journalists is the idea of granularity of your data source. There are a lot of ways to think about this: individual items in a list vs. figures in a table; original records vs. compilations; granular data vs. statistics.\nGenerally, an investigative reporter is interested in getting data that is as close as possible to the most granular information that exists, at least on computer files. Here’s an example , which might give you a little intuition about why it’s so important to think this way:\n\nExample: Death certificates\nWhen someone dies in the US, a standard death certificate is filled out by a series of officials - the attending physician, the institution where they died and even the funeral direcor.\n\n\n\ndeath certificate\n\n\nHere is a blank version of the standard US death certificate form – notice the detail and the detailed instructions on how it is supposed to be filled out.\nA good reporter could imagine many stories coming out of these little boxes. Limiting yourself to just to COVID-19-related stories: You could profile the local doctor who signed the most COVID-19-related death certificates in their city, or examine the number of deaths that had COVID as a contributing, but not underlying or immediate, cause of death. Or maybe you would want to map the deaths to find the block in your town most devastated by the virus.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, Coulter Jones and Jon Kamp of the Wall Street Journal examined the records from one of the few states that makes them public, and concluded that “Coronavirus Deaths were Likely Missed in Michigan, Death Certificates Suggest”\nBut you probably can’t do that. The reason is that, in most states, death certificates are not public records and are treated as secrets. 2. Instead, state and local governments provide limited statistics related to the deaths, usually by county, with no detail.\nHere’s an example from Arizona — note that we can only see statistics in the way the data source has decided we want to examine them, without access to the underlying information. There’s no way to look at age and race and gender combined for each county, just the generalized statistics for each category alone.\nHere are some of the typical (not universal) characteristics of granular vs. aggregated data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranular\nAggregate\n\n\n\n\nIntended for some purpose other than your work\nIntended to be presented as is to the public\n\n\nMany rows (records), few columns (variables)\nMany columns (variables), few rows (records)\n\n\nRequires a good understanding of the source\nExplanatory notes usually come with the data\n\n\nEasy to cross-reference and compile\nOften impossible to repurpose\n\n\nHas few numeric columns\nMay be almost entirely numerical\n\n\nIs intended for use in a database\nIs intended for use in a spreadsheet\n\n\n\nWe often have to consider the trade-offs. Granular data with the detail we need - especially when it involves personally identifiable information like names and addresses - can take months or years of negotiation over public records requests, even when the law allows it. It’s often much easier to convince an agency to provide summarized or incomplete data. Don’t balk at using it if it works for you. But you lose flexibility and have to live with the statistics compiiled for you if you have to settle..\nFor our purposes, it’s important to remember that we can always create aggregated numbers like the ones shown in the Arizona COVID page out of individual items, but you can never de-aggregate statistics into more granular data like the boxes filled out in death certificates."

In statistics, these rows might be called observations or cases. In data science, they’re usually called records. Either way, every row must represent the same thing – a person, a place, a year, a water sample or a school. And you can’t really do anything with it until you figure out what that noun is.\nSometimes the only noun you can obtain is problematic. In 2015, we did a story at The New York Times called “More Deportation Follow Minor Crimes, Records Show” . The government had claimed it was only removing hardened criminals from the country, but our analysis of the data suggested that many of them were for minor infractions.\nIn writing the piece, we had to work around a problem in our data: the agency refused to provide us anything that would help us distinguish one individual from another. All we knew was that each row represented one deportation, not a person. Without a column that uniquely identified people – say, name and date of birth, or some scrambled version of an their DHS number – we had no way to even estimate how often people were deported multiple times. If you read the story, you’ll see the very careful wording, except when we had reported out and spoken to people on the ground."

    "text": "3.1 Scripted journalism\n \nChristian McDonald at the University of Texas has described “scripted journalism” as data reporting that is “repeatable, transparent and annotated”.\nWe will be accomplishing those goals through the use of Quarto documents, which combine writing with analysis and results. The next chapter gets you started in Quarto. But by the end of this book, you will know how to produce a site like McDonald’s Major League Soccer analysis on your own as a way to document your work.\nSome news organizations and editors talk instead about the “data diary”. It’s the same idea, but often done a little less formally. Sometimes you’ll do work that doesn’t fit into the scripted journalism idea, such as a quick spreadsheet sort or some hand-cleaning of data. When you do that, be sure to keep a running list of all of the steps you took. Unlike programming languages, there’s no reminder of your mouse clicks.\nI generally work on two levels: For stories, I have a Google or other document that lists all of the datasets I’ve attempted to use to answer my questions, where I tried to get them, and what experts I interview say about them. I also list stories and studies that used the data in these documents. But I almost exclusively work in programming languages to test, clean and analyze data. And to the extent possible, I try to share any results using Quarto documents so that I always know everyone is working from the same version.\nThink of the data work the same way you think about interview notes or transcripts and any other research for a story. You wouldn’t quote a court case without reading it and probably talking to some of the participants. You’d make sure you know where to find the documents and what people say about them. You will consult those documents during your fact-checking. All data work – even the most short-lived – should be documented in at least the same detail. Ideally, someone reading through your notes would be able to repeat your work and understand what it means."

This would include:\n\nThe source of YOUR data, and how you know it’s authentic. Be specific. And don’t pretend you got it from the original source when you found it elsewhere, such as in this textbook or in a Github repository.\nDescribe the original source of the data and how it is collected and released.1\nTake notes on other stories and studies that use this or similar data. Include interview notes, advice, warnings and findings along with stories that have already been done.\nIdentify alternative sources for this and similar or related datasets or documents.\nSpecifically write down where you have stored all of this and how you have organized your work. You want to make sure you can get back to the latest version easily, and that you have all of the supporting documents you need to check it.\n\n\n\nData documentation and flaws\nI usually put the details of data documentation in a data cleaning Quarto document, which includes the code and the links to my files in one place. But no matter where you do it:\n\nInclude links or copies of any original documentation such as a record layout, data dictionary2 or manual. If there isn’t one, consider making a data dictionary with what you’ve learned.\nDocument the ways you checked the integrity of the data. There are many ways it might be inaccurate. Try to reconcile the number of rows and any totals you can produce to match other reports created by the source, or other reports that have used it. On longer stories, you’ll also check for impossible combinations (10-year-olds with DUIs), missing data and invalid data such as corrupted date columns.\nRecord any questions (and answers as you get them) about the meaning of fields or the scope of the data.\nDocument decisions you’ve made about the scope or method of your analysis. For example, if you want to look at “serious” crimes, describe how and why you categorized each crime as “serious” or “not serious.” Some of these should be vetted by experts or should be verified by documenting industry standards. You might note whether you’ve agreed as a team on these decisions, and when.\nInclude a list of interviews conducted / questions asked of officials and what they said.\n\n\n\nProcessing notes\nSome projects require many steps to get to a dataset that can be analyzed. You may have had to scrape the data, combine it with other sources or fix some entries. Some common elements you should document:\n\nHand-made corrections. Try to list every one, but it’s ok if you describe HOW you did it, such as clustering and hand-entering using OpenRefine. Link to any spreadsheet, document or program you used. Just be sure to always work on a copy of the data.\nGeocoding (affixing geographic coordinates to addresses). Note how many were correct, how many missing, and what you did about it.\nA description of how you got messy data into a tabular form or a form suitable for analysis. For example, you may have had to strip headings or flip a spreadsheet on its head. Make sure to write down how you did that.\n\n\n\nThe good part: Your analysis\n\nEach question you asked of your data, and the steps you took to answer it. If you use programming notebooks, write it out in plain language before or after the query or statements.\nVetting of your answers: who has looked them over, commented on them\nWhy they might be wrong!"

    "section": "4.1 An example: News21 “Hate in America”",
    "text": "4.1 An example: News21 “Hate in America”\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, News 21 – the multi-university investigative reporting fellowship hosted by ASU’s Cronkite School of Journalism – chose “Hate in America” as its topic for the year. It was a risk because others had been reporting on the subject for more than a year, making it more difficult for News 21 to break new ground. It was also difficult because it became clear quite quickly that no one had documented every case of hate crimes or hate-driven incidents in the U.S.\n\nData News 21 used\nThat meant that the team had to find some creative way to quantify the problem. Some of the sources they used included:\n\nRaw data from the National Crime Victimization Survey, an annual survey of crime victims that asks whether hate was an element of the crime. Reporters Catherine Devine and Allie Bice could have used data from a report produced by the Justice Department, but instead analyzed the raw data in a new way to show that about twice as many incidents may have been motivated by hate than previously acknowledged. That analysis was thoroughly vetted by experts in the survey, in hate crimes, and in criminology. It also created a structure around the entire package and provided a newsy lead to the overview story\nA database created by a team of reporters who monitored two weeks’ of social media activity from users associated with white nationalists, new-Nazis and other far-right groups on sites including Twitter, Facebook, Gab and VK. It enabled Kia Gardener to write:\n\n\nNews 21 monitored the daily social media activity of various far-right users, including white nationalists and neo-Nazis, from June 10 to June 24. Those tracked had more than 3 million followers combined. Reporters recorded and compiled more than 2,500 posts on popular platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, and emerging social media platforms, including Gab and VK.\n\n\nAbout half the posts were directed at specific demographics or communities, from black Americans and Latinos to Jewish people and LGBTQ members….\n\n\n– Social Media: Where voices of hate find a place to preach, News 21, August 2018\n\n\nFederal prosecutions of hate crimes under the various federal statutes. Reporter Lenny Martinez scraped all of the Justice Department’s hate crime-related press releases to find cases the government bragged about. Those cases were supplemented by a list of cases extracted from Westlaw federal case database. The team logged each case in a Google sheet to show what kinds of incidents were pursued by federal prosecutors, and where.\nProPublica’s “Documenting Hate” project, which, with the Southern Poverty Law Center, tried to compile as many stories as they could about hate incidents. ProPublica’s database was a tip sheet, not a quantification. But it served one key goal of any data source: a source reporters could consult when seeking specific types of examples in specific locations.\nThe FBI Uniform Crime Report’s Hate Crime series. They quickly learned that the data is seriously flawed because of non-response from local police departments and a squishy definition of what should be included. Another flaw was that others, including ProPublica, had thoroughly reported on those flaws and the trends in the data, meaning it failed the test of newsworthiness.\n\n\n\nData the team didn’t use\nThere were also sources that the team considered but didn’t pursue, sometimes because of the difficulty and sometimes because they were less useful to the project than expected:\n\nThe Justice Department’s U.S. attorney case management system, which provided details on cases that the government chose not to pursue along with those they did. (A subsequent analysis showed that the vast majority of these cases were rejected by prosecutors, but vetting the analysis proved too difficult in the time available.)\nDatabases of graffiti maintained by local police departments. This would have required public records requests to each department for records that usually aren’t clearly public. The team also contacted Google and other companies that publish street level images to see if it would be possible to isolate the hate symbols. Companies declined release images that their users had flagged as offensive.\nHistorical questions from the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research and the General Social Survey that might have shed light on attitudes about race and religion over time. These proved to be difficult to match up over the years and didn’t really provide much insight.\n\nThese are just some of the ways the News 21 team looked far and wide for any sources that could be methodically used to document their stories. As with any project of this type, the search often failed but along the way the whole team learned more and more about the topic and got to know experts in a way they wouldn’t have if they were just seeking quotes."

    "section": "4.2 Finding data and documents",
    "text": "4.2 Finding data and documents\nA big part of data reporting is finding, creating or acquiring records you can use electronically.\nSome sources of readily available data could include:\n\nGovernment agencies and open government sites\nHobbyists and interest groups\nData aggregators and data collectors\nAcademic researchers who might share their data\nMicrodata from surveys and some government programs, such as the Census, Medicare, the General Social Survey and several other standard sites.\nSocial data through API’s from Spotify, Twitter and other services.\nDetails scraped from online data sources that aren’t available in bulk.\n\nThere are also more difficult ways to find data:\n\nPublic records requests\nWhistleblower leaks\nHome made databases created from documents, and free text or image document collections.\nResponses to a survey that you conduct yourself.\nYour own testing on issues such as water quality or soil contamination.\n\nWhen you start on a project, you’ll usually rely on experts and advocates to lead you to a lot of the possible data sources. But you can also use these strategies to troll for interesting datasets that might make for good stories or practice.\nListen to any caveats and warnings. You may decide that they’re not important, but you don’t want to be blindsided by them in the end. And be sure to ask what they would do if they were you – often, people who have expertise in data have story or project ideas that they can’t get funded or approved, and would be happy for someone else to do them.\nWhen you search using Google, try to use the advanced commands to more precisely hit your target. This tipsheet goes through all of the Google advanced search operators. It changes a lot.\n\nGovernment agency sites\nTry to guess what government agencies – state, local and federal – have an interest in your topic. Browse through their websites to find “Publications” or “Data and research”, or any searchable database. You’ll often find downloadable data there. Once you learn more, you can also evaluate how hard it will be to scrape the data you want. Don’t limit yourself to the jurisdications you care about. If one city or state has a good dataset, there is a strong chance that your local government will have the same thing.\nLook at federal agency sites to find a least common denominator database – they are usually compiled from more detailed state or local reports.\nEven if you can’t find the database, you might be able to find the name of a datset that is maintained internally in audits, footnotes of reports, or IT initiatives.\nOnce you know a good agency to search, use advanced Google searches for filetype:csv or filetype:xlsx, and limit the site to an agency or city site to bring up datasets that they are letting users download.\n\n\nNews reports\nOne of the most useful sources to find the names of databases and their original sources is news reports that relied on the data, or refers to a data source quoted by experts. It doesn’t matter if you’re looking at your own area or others – most places have the same kinds of information collected and stories are similar across geographic areas.\nYou should get good at using all of the resources as precisely as you can. That means getting very familiar with advanced searching in Google, and using LexisNexis and other news databases provided by the ASU library. These offer much more targeted searching than the usual Google search, and will result in much more on-point stories. When you find a good story, consider logging it in a spreadsheet or in doc, and identify:\n\nWho wrote it and when\nWhat government sources of data are explicitly mentioned.\nWhat analysis of that data was done by the news outlet, or what research it depended on.\nAny terms of art that seem to be used around your topic. For example, hate crimes are more frequently referred to as “bias” crimes in many articles – searching for “hate” might not surface them.\n\n\nIRE.org tipsheets\nAnother source for information on news stories that used data reporting is IRE, which has two ways to search for more details: the ire.org tip sheets and story archive. Log into IRE.org and choose the tipsheets to look for guides from other reporters; choose the story database to look for stories on your general topic and then click into the form that the reporters filled out that go through their sources. You’ll often find a pair of them – a story, and a tip sheet – that were done by the same person the same year.\n(The database library is currently undergoing some review, so a lot of the data listed there could be out of date. But it might also point you to standard sources for data.)\n\n\n\nAcademic articles\nMake sure to do a Google Scholar search for your topic. You will often find one or two researchers who have delved into your subject or a single source. This is often a great shortcut. For example, in the News 21 example, a search of hate crimes in Google Scholar identified an article called “Documenting Hate Crimes in the United States: Some consideration on data sources,” from APA PsycNet. Although this was specifically about sexual orientation and gender diversity, it cataloged the different ways that scholars try to document bias crimes. Once Devine settled on the crime victimization survey, another Google scholar search surfaced an expert on the survey who wrote about how it had changed over the years. He turned out to be the former chief of the Justice Department section that ran the survey, and was one of the project’s best sources. Another source led her to the book, “Statistics for Criminology and Criminal Justice.” One of the authors of that book also provided advice.\nAnother value of this approach is that it will help you find the technical jargon for the topic you’re studying. It’s often very difficult to do literature searches without knowing that term.\n\n\nThink tanks / interest groups\nTry to find some interest groups that care a lot about your topic on all sides. They often have websites with recent research on your topic and might have experts you can consult. Take their advice cautiously because they often have a point to prove and are unabashed about twisting data to make their point. However, you can often use their raw data to draw your own conclusions. Some news organizations frown on this, so be sure to be transparent about who they are and what they’ve done.\nAnother good way to use interest groups and think tanks is to get initial versions of public records from them while you wait for your own requests to be processed. At The Washington Post, we used an old version of a weapons trace database for a year while we fought the government for our own; we also used a copy of Agriculture subsidies acquired by the Environmental Working Group while we were waiting for our own public records requests to be completed.\nSometimes, gathering the Tweets from advocates can provide a rich dataset, and it’s relatively easy to do. For example, I once used the Twitter posts from the Police Misconduct project out of the Cato Institute to get a list of all of the stories they’d compiled on the topic.\n\n\nData collectors\nSeveral sites are trying to make businesses out of collected and maintaining databases. Others make available data that they have collected in the past.\nBe sure to look at the original source for any data you find there. You wouldn’t say a news article came from Google News or Lexis, and you wouldn’t say a dataset came from Google Data Search. If it’s not documented at all, you might have to contact the owner for more detail.\nBe careful of most of these. They’re often old, undocumented and poorly vetted. But they will give you a sense of what you might be able to get from a more reliable source, or give you ideas for your own data collection effort.\n*data.world** wants to be the Facebook or Instagram of data. It has both private and public accounts, and users upload data they want to share. This means it’s as varied as the people who are in it.\nIf your newsroom is an AP member, you might have access to its data.world feed, which contains its curated and documented data that local newsrooms can use for their own stories. Some reporters also use data.world to store their public records. Some government agencies are posting their data directly to data.world. But in other cases, they’re undocumented hobbyists.\nVet these the same way you would Google results.\n*Journalists’ sites** You can often find individual journalists or journalism organizations in various sharing sites, including Github (which doesn’t show up in default Google searches), data.world and other versioning. Look through their sites to see what they have collected – it’s there to share. Fivethirtyeight, ProPublica and the Los Angeles Times have particularly active data archives.\n*Google data search** is, well, the Google of data. In general, data search has limited sources and is more and more frequently logging datasets that are posted by state and local government sources.\nIt makes no attempt to curate the search, though, so be cautious when you find something.\nOne use for the dataset search is to see what other cities and counties have voluntarily released. When you see that, it often means your local or state government might have similar data you can request.\nFor example, searching for police shootings brings up a dataset released by the Orlando Police Department, which contains far more detail than the same dataset released by Phoenix in 2018:\n\n\n\norlando pd\n\n\nBe sure to look for different terms meaning the same thing. For example, searching “use of force” brings you to completely different sets of data than “police shootings”."

    "text": "5.1 The evolution of a home-made database\nThe day in December 2015 that a San Bernadino couple killed 14 people, The New York Times published a short story called “How Often Do Mass Shootings Occur? On Average, Every Day, Records Show”.\nThat daily story spurred the Times to embark on a project to document each mass shooting in America for a year. Five months later, it published this story:\n\n\nHere is how Sharon LaFraniere, Daniela Porat and Agustin Armendariz described the results of their work about 10 paragraphs into the story. (I suggest you also read the lede on your own - it’s an exquisite example of framing a lede anecdote with detail and context.)\n\nSeeking deeper insight into the phenomenon, The New York Times identified and analyzed these 358 shootings with four or more casualties, drawing on two databases assembled from news reports and citizen contributors, and then verifying details with law enforcement agencies.\nOnly a small handful were high-profile mass shootings like those in South Carolina and Oregon. The rest are a pencil sketch of everyday America at its most violent.\nThey chronicle how easily lives are shattered when a firearm is readily available — in a waistband, a glove compartment, a mailbox or garbage can that serves as a gang’s gun locker. They document the mayhem spawned by the most banal of offenses: a push in a bar, a Facebook taunt, the wrong choice of music at a house party. They tally scores of unfortunates in the wrong place at the wrong time: an 11-month-old clinging to his mother’s hip, shot as she prepared to load him into a car; a 77-year-old church deacon, killed by a stray bullet while watching television on his couch.\nThe shootings took place everywhere, but mostly outdoors: at neighborhood barbecues, family reunions, music festivals, basketball tournaments, movie theaters, housing project courtyards, Sweet 16 parties, public parks. Where motives could be gleaned, roughly half involved or suggested crime or gang activity. Arguments that spun out of control accounted for most other shootings, followed by acts of domestic violence.\nThe typical victim was a man between 18 and 30, but more than 1 in 10 were 17 or younger. Less is known about those who pulled the triggers because nearly half of the cases remain unsolved. But of those arrested or identified as suspects, the average age was 27.\nMost of the shootings occurred in economically downtrodden neighborhoods. These shootings, by and large, are not a middle-class phenomenon.\nThe divide is racial as well. Among the cases examined by The Times were 39 domestic violence shootings, and they largely involved white attackers and victims. So did many of the high-profile massacres, including a wild shootout between Texas biker gangs that left nine people dead and 18 wounded.\nOver all, though, nearly three-fourths of victims and suspected assailants whose race could be identified were black. Some experts suggest that helps explain why the drumbeat of dead and wounded does not inspire more outrage.\n\nNotice how the authors weave the details that were chronicled in their database with the data points. Now, try to imagine how their dataset might have been organized to allow for such a rich description of the phenomenon.\nThe database, built by Armendariz, and mostly reported by Porat, was designed to anticipate this writing phase:\n\nThe database was split into two separate tables – one that detailed the 358 events and another that detailed the 1,592 victims.\nIt included links to original FOIA requests and documentation they’d need for fact-checking.\nSome columns were categories or items that would be summarized – the ages and ethnicity of the victims, the severity of the injury, and whether it was solved. But much of the data included was detailed descriptions that could be searched using sophisticated filters. Still others were tagged with one-word descriptions that allowed the reporters to pluck just the right examples for just the right part of the story, using words like “suspected gang”, “child”, or “party”. Over time, these tags were reviewed and revised, which is common on small databases like this.\nFact-checking and information for publication was included in the database. For example, the database logged photos, interview and contact notes, and specific entries for name spelling and fact checks. That way the reporters could focus on what was NOT ready for publication, rather than review things they’d already checked.\n\nWhat didn’t they do?\nThey didn’t bother to standardize names and addresses into their pieces – they had no interest in counting how many “Smith”s were in the database, and didn’t care how often they occurred a Main Street.\nIn other contexts, these fields might be important, but they were only required for filtering and sorting, not for counting. There was no reason to make it more difficult to fill out the database than necessary.\nThey also didn’t try to publish the full dataset. That’s an important consideration, especially if the data you are collecting contains sensitive or potentially erroneous information. Getting it to that level of accuracy might have added several months to the project, and probably would not have served readers any better. (The bare bones list of cases, with a few exceptions, was already available and updated elsewhere.)"

    "text": "5.2 When to build your own database\nThere are a few common reasons to design and build your own data for stories:\n\nThere is a long-running story that is periodically updated with new documents or events that you want to track.\nOne reporter created a spreadsheet to log each event related to Jack Kevorkian, a doctor who became famous for helping people commmit suicide. His list made it easy for him to write a story every time another person died, because he had the full list of people and circumstances and knew what he’d already fact-checked.\nMy first data-driven set of stories came from following the actions of George Steinbrenner, the former principle owner of the New York Yankees, whose family owned a failing shipbuilding company in Tampa in the early 1990s. After I pressed the “sort” button, I discovered that each time he helped the company gain new Navy contracts by lending it money, he demanded repayment as soon as the contract was signed, sending it back into a downward spiral.\nYou are getting information from disparate sources and you need an easy way to search them, arrange them chronologically, and keep track of what you need to verify. Examples include reviewing court cases across jurisdictions or compiling death records from many medical examiners’ officers. This would also work for tracking your own FOIA requests. You’ve read about this in Michael Berens’ story of a serial killer in Illinois.\nYou want to fill in details for every item on a list, like the mass shootings story above. This is quite common – you might have a list of opioid overdose deaths from the medical examiner, but you want to fill out the details of this case. At USA Today, Anthony DeBarros did this after 9/11 to tell the story of every person killed in the World Trade Center, including where they were when the planes hit."

But when it gets a little more complicated or you want more control over the data types and choices, you might choose to use a different product.\nAirtable is one option (ASU has an enterprise account, which will kick in when you create an account with your school email address). More recently, Microsoft created “Lists” to your 365 account, and Google added “Tables” to your Google account. Airtable and Tables are quite limited in the free edition – so limited that you may find it doesn’t meet your needs. But even if you can’t use it for your full dataset, it might be useful as a sandbox for you to test different ways to set up your dataset.\nThese products let you set up related tables, such as the events events and people tables used in the Times story, and create tags or other structured items for you spreadsheet.

    "section": "5.4 How to start",
    "text": "5.4 How to start\nWork with everyone who might use the dataset before you start to set out goals. Think about the full range of issues that might come up. Most importantly, how are you going to get the information and how long will it take? Is it just a list of things in chronological order or to provide a quick overview of your reporting? Or are you trying to count specific types of events, such as police shootings by race or gender or the lawyer who has had the most disciplinary actions taken?\nThe difference is whether you are primarily using your dataset for sorting and filtering versus grouping and counting by category.\nYou should also assume that you won’t be able to get all of the information you’d hoped, and that real life doesn’t often fit into neat rectangular boxes. So it’s fine to put in some aspirational columns in case you can get the details, but be sure to stay realistic. If it takes too long to fill out a row in your database, you won’t do it.\nHere are some other considerations:\n\nTry to find an interest group or academic researcher who has already tried to tally the information you’re collecting. They may have good structures that you can adapt to your project. If you can’t, try to find a standard that you want to measure your results against – was a policy followed or not, or was a case solved or not? These are the key statistics that will identify the newsworthiness of your results.\nCarefully define your “universe”. In the case of the Washington Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “Fatal Flaws” series on deadly police shootings, the reporters chose to focus only on deaths that were the result of gun discharges in the line of duty. That means they aren’t able to talk about all of the people killed by police, nor all of the people killed in custody, because some happen off hours and others are strangulations or other causes of death. In other cases, you may choose to FOIA the top 50 cities or counties and ignore all the rest. It’s ok to limit your universe. Just be sure that your entire team knows and agrees to the definitions and the limits that places on the results.\nWhat is your unit of analysis, or the noun you use to describe a row in your database? Do you want to count events, people, cases, years, or something else? If so, you should have one and only one row for each of those things, which may mean splitting your work inot more than one data frame or table, the way the Times reporters did for people and events.\nBuild your data dictionary before you start filling out the database, and keep adjusting it as you have to adapt to the real world. Make sure to include a detailed data type (eg, a list separated by semicolons, long text, category, number, date….), and list any standardized words or codes you plan to use (“Y” or “N” for yes and no, for example) .\nReduce the number of columns by smartly combining categories into tags, and considering the way you’ll use a field. For example, sorting by street name isn’t usually very useful (especially when you can filter for it), so there may be no reason to split the street number, name, etc. into different columns. If you enter names in a standard format (eg, Last, First Middle Suffix), then they’re easy to split later on but can be kept in one column and still be sorted. In other words, consider whether you want to be able to sort, filter or count entries. Each of them requires a different level of standardization.\nAnticipate errors. One of the more common problems in creating your own dataset is that the whole purpose of it is to sort or arrange it by date, so you have to enter dates properly. But we rarely do get the exact date for every item in the list. There are several strategies for this, such as entering year, month and day in different columns; or entering an approximate date, and flagging it as “approximate” in a separate field (my preference).\nBuild in fact-checking. If nothing else, be sure to include the source of the information in the row, and provide a way to get back to the original quickly. For example, if you are typing in events from a court case, enter a link to the case folder in one field, and the page number of the item you’re entering in another. If I’m publishing anything from the dataset, I include columns for name checks, fact checks and even whether the narrative has been copy edited.\nHow many columns do you really want? On a spreadsheet, things can bet pretty unwieldy pretty fast. Try to avoid having more than about 15 columns, and try to define them so that most are filled out.\n\nThis is an example of a spreadsheet created to log the first 100 days of the Obama administration. The “subject_tags” column let the reporters enter a variety of categories, which were then normalized when it came time to use them.\n\n\n\n100 days\n\n\nThose tags resulted in it being relatively easy to create graphics like this by filtering for related tags and ordering it by date:\n\n\n\nreversals"

Another case several years earlier had the same telltale problems.\nThe Times obtained several key documents in the other case.* You can read a copy of the internal affairs report yourself, but you quickly come away realizing that it’s hard to follow, repetitive and you’re never quite sure what’s happened.

But no investigation was immediately opened, records show.\nOne sergeant did prepare an affidavit documenting the accusations. But he was told by his supervisor to hold it back, so he stuck it under the visor in his squad car, where it remained, even after another officer became aware of further incidents, according to Mr. Harris’s internal affairs file.\nThe case came to a head on Christmas Eve, when his wife fled their house and called the police. Internal affairs officers uncovered other possible acts of domestic violence before his hiring, records show. His wife said that before they married, he had held a knife to her throat and hit her. His ex-wife said he had threatened her with a gun. No charges were filed.\nCol. Todd R. Thompson, the sheriff’s director of law enforcement, recommended that Mr. Harris be fired, saying his actions were “particularly egregious and trouble me deeply.”\n\nWas it necessary to create a spreadsheet logging almost 100 events in this case? No. But we had to go through every document in detail anyway, and this meant we didn’t have to do it over and over again."

In “Learning how to Learn”, Jesse Lesy says:\n\nIf this is your first programming language, you will get frustrated at times. Take a step back and remember that after a semester of Spanish you can only operate at the level of a three-year old. You only know one verb tense, a few dozen verbs, and several hundred words. You have so many emotions that you can’t express in your new language!\n\nWhen you get very frustrated – and you WILL get very frustrated at times – walk away from the computer for a little while. You may see a solution staring right back at you. But if you still can’t imagine what to do next, get help. As Lecy says, your morale is a valuable commodity and it shouldn’t be squandered.\nThe good news for journalists is that you can accomplish most of what we need with the vocabulary of a three-year-old. Much of what we do in R is accomplished using six verbs: filter, mutate, arrange, group by, summarize and join.\nThis section goes in depth in a couple of areas that flummox some people: Installing and getting used to the screens in R and RStudio; and getting data into the program by importing. Then it shows off some of the things you’ll be able to do in just a couple of weeks.\nDon’t worry if you’re just copying and pasting at this point. It’s important to get used to the screens and the process without worrying about substance at first. That’s why programming language tutorials often start with printing, “Hello, world!” – it’s something that every program does, but a does it a little differently."

    "text": "6.1 Install R and RStudio\nR is the programming language itself, and has to be installed first. Andrew Heiss has called it the “engine” behind your work. RStudio, made by the company posit.co, is the way we’ll interact with the programming language. Install it second. Heiss calls it the “fancy car” that you drive.\nMost students prefer to install the software on their own laptops, but there are other options in the backup plan section.\n\nFollow along with the tutorial in this link to install R, RStudio and the package called the tidyverse on your computer.\nhttps://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/#section-welcome\n\nThe video is a little old. Here are the differences today:\n\nThere are now two versions of R for Mac: One for older (pre-2022) computers with an Intel chip, and another called ARM64 for Macs with M1 or M2 chips. Be sure to choose the one for your computer. You can tell which one you have by clicking on the apple symbol, and choosing “About this Mac”. If it says “Intel”, then you have the older version.\nThe download link for RStudio is now https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nIf you go all the way through the tutorial, installing the tidyverse will take a while and look like it’s stuck. It’s not. Just get some coffee and come back in 10 minutes. This only has to be done once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop if it isn’t working\n\n\n\nThis should be easy, but don’t spend more than about 30 minutes trying to get this to work, and don’t try to Google your way out of any problems – the answers could be old, wrong, or make it harder. This isn’t worth your time or frustration. Contact me if there’s any problem and we’ll work it out.\n\n\n\nDetails on installing R\nLink to find your version: https://cloud.r-project.org/. As of December 2023, the version is 4.3.\nMac OS:\n\n\n\nThe version you see will be higher than “4.1”. As of December 2023, it’s 4.3\n\n\nParts of RStudio depend on “command line tools” in a Mac. If you’re asked to install it, say “Yes”. If you get a warning or error about it, ask me to help you. It’s a simple fix. RStudio will actually work without it, but you’ll get a lot of annoying warnings.\nWindows 10/11:\nYou only need the “base” version for our class. You do not need to install RTools. Try to install it as an administrator – we’ve had a little trouble finding the right paths when it’s installed at the user level.\n\n\nBackup plan\n\nLabs in school\nYou do not need to own a computer to take this class. R and RStudio should be set up properly n our classroom and the lab in Cronkite 320. ASU’s computing sites such as the lab in UCENT L-102 across from Cronkite also have the basic software installed but you may need to tweak it each time you sign on. Let me know if you are using university labs and I’ll help you make it a little more efficient.\n\n\nPosit cloud\nPosit Cloud allows you to use R and RStudio without installing it on your computer. Use it as a last resort. Believe me, this will be a pain, but it can work to get you started. We’ll work together to find a solution longer term.\nSome limitations:\n\nYou’ll have to upload everything you want to use to the cloud, then download the final (saved) versions when you want to turn them in.\nHistorically, it hasn’t worked very well on the Quarto documents that we’ll be using. You might not be able to see your finished document, which is a big deal for us.\nYou can only use 1GB RAM - this won’t be enough for some projects.\nYou only get 25 hours per month to use it. During the key part of our course, you should run out of time and won’t be able to access your work until you pay. (The $5/month plan would work.)\nYou have to remember to save your work and periodically restart R. It doesn’t remind you and you might lose everything by closing out a tab. If you don’t save and process your documents right before turning in your work, there’s a good chance I’ll see an earlier draft.\n\nYou will have to upgrade to a paid account (minimum $5/month) if you try to use it for the whole the semester. I’ve never understood the plan costs and limits – they’re quite strict, and you won’t be able to log into your account if you try to go beyond them."

    "text": "7.1 Building blocks\n\nVariables\nA variable is a container with a name. You pour things into the container Sometimes, those things are simple like your name. Sometimes they’re quite complex, such as the contents of a Spotify playlist. In R, many people use the terms variable and object interchangeably.1\nThe three most common structures of variables are:\n\nLiterals\nThe most basic kind of object is a single variable that contains a single value of a specific type:\n\n\"Sarah\" (text)\n1.0 (number)\ntrue (logical)\n2017-01-24. (date)\n\nThese are called “literals”. When you want to use the actual letters of some text, enclose them in quotes. When you want to use the named variable, don’t enclose it in quotes: my_name &lt;- \"Sarah\"\n\n\nLists or vectors\nMost languages have some concept of a list of items called an array, vector or dictionary. In R, you create a vector using the “c” operator, short for “combine”. Once you have your items in a list or a vector, you can apply the same function across all of them or work on them in order. :\n\nc(1, 17, 2, 120, 4)\nc(\"Sarah\", \"Richard\", \"Rachel\")\n\n\n\nData frames\nA data frame is the R equivalent of a spreadsheet page. It’s tabular, rectangular data with columns and rows. You don’t need to know much about this yet, but just understand that it will become an important part of your vocabulary.\n\n\n\nOperators & assignment\nOperators are simple arithmetic or similar operations, like adding, subtracting, dividing and multiplying. Some common operators are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nWhat it does\n\n\n\n\n \nArithmetic\n\n\n+\nAdd\n\n\n-\nSubtract\n\n\n*\nMultiply\n\n\n/\nDivide\n\n\n \nComparison (in R)\n\n\n==\nEqual - Notice the TWO equal signs\n\n\n&gt;\nGreater than (or &gt;= greater than or equal to)\n\n\n&lt;\nLess than (or &lt;= less than or equal to)\n\n\n!=\nNot equal to\n\n\n \nAssignment\n\n\n&lt;- or =\nPush a value in to a variable name. In R, most people assign a value to a variable using the &lt;- operator, and save = to provide information to functions. There are a lot of ways to think of this – Some might call it “naming a value”, and others might say it’s “setting a variable”. Visualizing the &lt;- arrow pushing something into a variable name can sometimes help.\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions\nA function is a verb or a set of instructions wrapped up into a single word. Use its name, followed by some parentheses. If it requires information from you, those arguments go inside the parentheses.\nIf you think of it as a sentence, the function is the verb, and the arguments are the nouns and adjectives. It genearally takes the form:\nfunction ( data, option_name=\"value\")\nMany of the functions we use are already built into R, or are in libraries that we borrow – someone else has already written, tested and packaged them up for you.\nExamples include:\n\nimporting text or Excel data\ncalculating the average or sum\ncounting\nfinding phrases within text\n\nSome functions work only with numbers; others work only with text or dates or some other data type.\n\n\nLoops\nA loop is a way to repeat your instructions over and over without having to re-write them every time. They usually work by stepping through some kind of a list, like a directory of files, or by using a counter, such as every year between 2005 and 2018.\nExcel and Google Sheets don’t really have loops, unless you learn the more complicated programming language behind them. This is the motivation behind learning a programming language for a lot of people.\nOne type of loop commonly used in programs is a for loop, which says, “for every one of something, follow these instructions”.\nSee if you can follow the pseudocode of putting sunglasses or hats on monsters depending on their shape:\n\n\n\nAlison Horst\n\n\nCommon tasks that reporters do with loops include combining annual spreadsheets from a government website or downloading and importing many files at once; and scraping web pages that require clicking into each link one by one. We’ll get to this at the end of the semester."

Think of it as a very powerful calculator at first. One reason to use it is to install packages.\nIf you followed the installation demo, you’ve already used the console to install one package using the command install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). Go back and do that part now if you skipped it. It might take several minutes to finish.\n\n\nFiles tab\nWe won’t be using many of the tabs in the lower right, but the Files tab can help you if you’re having trouble navigating your work. Under the More button, you can choose “Go to working directory”, since that’s where R thinks you’ve parked all of your work. This can be confusing in R, which is why we’ll be working in “projects” that bundle up all of your work in one place. (I don’t find the Help sections in this area very helpful. Instead, I usually rely on written manuals elsehwere, such as tidyverse official site. )\n\n\nEnvironment\nThe upper right screen is the Environment, which is where your active objects live. An object, sometimes called a “variable” in R, is a named thing. It might be a word, a list of words or numbers, or a data frame (spreadsheet). It can even be a little program called a function that you write yourself.\nAnything that you want to use has to be loaded or created into that environment first. That might involve importing data from Excel or a text file, or creating data yourself in a program.\n\n\nTyping into the console\nWhen you type this: 5+5 after the &gt; prompt and press return, you’ll see: [1] 10\nWhen you type this: \"Sarah\" , you’ll get this back: [1] \"Sarah\"\nTo create a new variable, you’ll use the assignment operator &lt;- (two characters : A less than sign and a hyphen). Here is how I would create the variable called my_name (lower case, no spaces). Notice how it appears in the Environment after being created. Then I can print it by typing the name of the variable instead of the letters of my name in quotes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro tip\n\n\n\nUse the keyboard shortcut  to create the &lt;- assignment operator .\n\n\nThe console remembers your commands, but you have to type them one at a time and you can’t save them for later, or start over without entering them all again.

R is almost useless to a normal person without them. There are more than 10,000 packages available for R, each doing a special job.\nIf you followed along with the tutorial in the last chapter, the final step was to install a package called the tidyverse. Almost everything we do from now on depends on that.\nThe tidyverse is a system of packages, or libraries, that work together with similar grammar and syntax. It’s particularly useful for the kind of work reporters do – importing, cleaning and analyzing data that we get from others. For many reporters (myself included), R was too difficult to learn before the tidyverse came around. We’ll be working almost exclusively within the tidyverse in this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearching for help\n\n\n\nWhen you search for help, be sure to put “tidyverse” somewhere in your query. If you don’t , you’re likely to get inscrutible answers.\nperplexity.ai and ChatGPT are two artificial intelligence sites that can help you with your code. These AI sites are particularly good at troubleshooting code – describe your data, copy and paste your code, and ask it what’s wrong! I tend to use the Perplexity site. Some of the methods shown in this book are newer than the ChatGPT cutoff date.2\nEither one is usually better than just Googling. If you do use Google, be sure to set a date cutoff – R has changed a LOT in the last five years.\n\n\n\nInstalling packages for this course\nWe need to update your packages and install a few more for our work.\nIf this is the first time you’ve installed it, the tidyverse will take a while to install, and it will look like it’s just stopped. Be patient. It can take 5 minutes or more.\nYou only have to install packages once on each machine you use. Later on, you’ll learn how to invoke them one by one.\n\nOption 1: Use the console\n\nCopy these commands into your Console.

We’ll only be using Quarto for R using RStudio, but it also works in other languages such as Python and Javascript. Some news organizations do much of their internal work using Quarto and its predecessor, RMarkdown.\nThis entire book is written as a series of Quarto documents!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto is modern RMarkdown\n\n\n\nMany help pages and tutorials in R use the format called RMarkdown (.Rmd) instead of Quarto (.qmd), which was introduced in mid-2022. There are very few substantive differences.\n\n\n\nThe structure of a Quarto document\nThere are four parts to a Quarto document:\n\nNarrative and document features, including headlines, subheads, images and other elements that you’d normally put in any document.\nThe “front matter”, or YAML1, instructions for the entire document, such as a title or the output format. You will often copy and paste this part rather than trying to get it right freehand.\nLittle portions of your R programs in code chunks, similar to the lines you entered in the Console in the last chapter.\nThe results of code chunks - what you get back when you execute the code, including charts, graphs, tables and maps.\n\n\n\nMarkdown, an editing language\nIn Quarto, your narration is written using Markdown, which was invented as an easy way for early Wikepedia editors to write simple documents that would automatically be rendered into the more complicated HTML of the web. Once you get used to Markdown, you may never go back to Google Docs or Word.\n\nReview the first five sections of the markdown basics instructions from Quarto, paying attention to:\n\nText formatting, like bold and italic\nLinks\nHeadings\nLists (ordered and unordered)\nOptional: Tables\n\nWe probably won’t use anything below the Tables section in this class.\n\n\n\nFront matter / YAML at the top\nThe way the R knows how to process the page is by reading the very top of the file and looking at the section between three dashes. This is called “front matter”, and it’s extremely picky about indentations and the exact words you use.\nThe default setup is very basic. For this class, I’ll ask you to use the following options, and edit them to correct the title and author each day. This will already be filled out for you in some of the early assignments.2\n---\ntitle: \"A title for your page\"\nauthor: \"Your name\"\nformat: \n  html: \n    theme: cosmos\n    embed-resources: true\n    toc: true\n    code-tools: true\n    page-layout: full\n    df-print: paged\n---\n\n\nIncluding R code and its results\nSo far, nothing is different from a simple Google doc or Word document – there is no computer code or data involved. But the value of Quarto is that it allows you to mix your analysis with your writing in one place.\nYou’ll do that through code chunks – little snippets of working code that you insert within your narrative which, when processed, will also include the results. Each code chunk has a Play button in its upper-right corner. Once you’re done typing, you’ll press that button to run just that code chunk.\nTo insert a code chunk:\n\nUse the +C button on the top right of your screen. ( )\nUse the keyboard shortcut  (Cmd-Opt-i)\n\n\nThe following code chunk creates a new variable called my_variable, another called my_name.\n\n```{r}\n# Anything between ```{r} at the beginning and ``` at the end is the code chunk.   \n# A hashtag within an R program or code chunk means the line is a \"comment\". \n# R will ignore it.\n\n\nmy_variable &lt;- 13   #&lt;1&gt; \nmy_name &lt;- \"Sarah\"  #&lt;2&gt;\n```\n\nWhen you press the Play button, nothing comes out. That’s because you saved your variables.

You can set up RStudio to default to source mode by changing the global options under Tools -&gt; Global Options , then look for R Markdown, and the Visual tab."

Get in the habit of opening your projects this way.\nCreate a new document (File -&gt; New -&gt; Quarto document) with three things about yourself in a list, a picture of an animal you love or some other image you like, and a code chunk.\n\n\n\nStep by step\n\nFind an image of your favorite animal or another image you like, and save it in the project folder that you created above.\nOpen RStudio first, then open the project using the drop-down at the top right of your screen (or through the File -&gt; Open project menu item).\nCreate a new Quarto document.\nSwitch to Source mode from Visual mode .\nDelete the entire default entry, including the stuff at the very top.\nCopy the code above to the very top of the page. Don’t leave any blank lines above it.\nChange your name and the title in that top section.\nSave the new Quarto document using the name yourlastname-firstquarto\nThe area below the three dashes is your document. In it, create:\n\nA subhed introducing a subtopic, called “About me”\nWithin that heading, a list of three things about yourself or about a topic you love, in an unordered (bulleted) list.\nAnother subhed , called “An image I love”, with some text below it describing why you love it\nThe image that you saved into your project folder\nAnother subhed called “Some R code”\nA code chunk, in which you create a variable , assign it a value, and then print it out.\n\nSave your work\nRender the document to a final html file. (Rendering automatically saves, but it’s good practice to do it yourself.)\n\n\n\nCommon problems\n\nYou haven’t saved the document yet.\nThere is an error in that top YAML section. Copy the code above and try again. It’s really picky.\nThere is an error in your R code. Look for a visual hint that shows you what’s wrong.\nYou deleted the ending back-ticks at the end of the code chunk. Your whole screen turned gray and there’s no Play button. Add three back-ticks after your code to get back on track.\nEverything’s too smushed together. The subheds, for example, have to have a space after the hashtag, and the lists have to have a blank line above them. Give your document room to breathe by inserting blank lines between elements. If you’re having trouble, switch back to visual mode and fix it there, then look at it again in Source mode.\n\n\n\nExample document\nYou can look at the original Quarto code and the rendered document, but remember that if you were doing this yourself, you’d have to have the image saved in the same folder as your project. I changed the theme so you could see some of the variations."

The rankings, published by Billboard Media, are currently based on sales (physical and digital), radio play, and online streaming. The methods and policies of the chart have changed over time.\n\n\nThe data we will use here is a combination of data collected by Kaggle user Dhruvil Dave, along with some scraping and merging by Prof. McDonald. It is stored on the code sharing website Github for safe keeping.\n\n\nThe data dictionary\nAs of December 2023, this version of runs from its inception in August 1958 through mid-June 2023, before most of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour sent her Hot 100 numbers even higher.\nHere is a data dictionary , sometimes called a record layout to go along with the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable name\ntype\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nCHART WEEK\ndate\nThe release date of the chart in the form “m/d/yyyy”\n\n\nTHIS WEEK\nnumber\nThe rank (1 through 100) of the song that week\n\n\nTITLE\ncharacter\nSong title\n\n\nPERFORMER\ncharacter\nPerformer, as published in the chart.

This means that there will be lots of rows for each week, and a row for each song every time it was on the hot 100."

This file is a CSV file, which stands for “comma-separated values”. Some other forms are shown in Appendix C: File Types in the Wild\nWhen you import the file, R will guess what each column is – text (“chr”), numbers (“num” “), and date or date/time (”date” or “POSIX” in R).\n(From now on, you’ll just see the R code that goes inside a code chunk you create, not the part with the backticks and brackets.)\n\n\nCreate a new code chunk using the Insert Chunk button  at the top right of your document, or using the keyboard shortcut .\nUse the clipboard icon below to copy the code and paste into your code chunk.

Use just the name of the file, in quotes, if it’s already saved in your projects folder.\n\n4\n\nDon’t forget to close your parentheses.\n\n\n\n\nAfter running the code chunk, you should see something like this:\n\n\nRows: 341100 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): CHART WEEK, TITLE, PERFORMER\ndbl (4): THIS WEEK, LAST WEEK, PEAK POS., WKS ON CHART\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nSo R found:\n\n341,100 rows (or records, or observations).\n7 columns ,\n3 of which it thinks are character types, and 4 that it thinks should be numbers.\nIt named the columns using the first row of the file.\n\nThis method of reading a file accepts the default options for importing. You may need to override some of them at times, especially when R guesses your data types incorrectly.\n\nStop a minute and think about what you just did in one second – you imported a dataset with MORE THAN a quarter of a MILLION rows without any complaint!\n\nThere is now a new object in your Enviornment tab, under “Data”, called top100, with “341,100 obs. of 7 variables”.\n\nImport tips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosit cheat sheets\n\n\n\nThe “Data import with the Tidyverse” cheat sheet goes through the details of importing data.

For the time being, consider downloading your Google Sheet to a csv in your project folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault to character columns\n\n\n\nIf you’re not sure about the data types of each column, use an option to import them all as text, or character, columns. Then you can fix them one by one. Text will (almost) never be a problem. The option looks like this:\nread_csv( \"your file name or URL\", col_types=c(.default=\"c\") )"

    "text": "12.2 Understanding data types\nWhen each column holds the same piece of information, it makes sense that each value in that column should be of the same type. Many of the errors or problems in your programs will come from trying to use text when something else is required, or trying to use text when a number is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the data dictionary!\n\n\n\nWhenever you get a dataset, you should look for a “data dictionary”, “record layout” or similar document. They tell you what each column is called and what type of data is held in it.\n\n\nHere are the four most common data types you’ll see in reporting:\n\nText. Text or “character” columns can come in long or short form. When they are standardized (the values can contain only one of a small list of values), they’re called “categorical”.In reporting, we frequently treat any value that you don’t want to use in a mathematical formula as text. For instance, there is no concept of the sum of Zip Codes. We would treat them as text values to keep them separate from values. Text is the least common denominator of data – all other types can be represented as text, but the reverse isn’t true.\nDon’t confuse a text value with the name of a variable or object. For example, the column zipcode might contain the value “01243”. The name of the column is unquoted, and the value within it is.\nNumbers. These are pure numbers with no commas, dollar signs or other embellishments. You can present them as formatted values that are easier to look at, but underneath they’re just numbers.In R, these could be integers (whole numbers), or double-precision values (those that have a lot of numbers after the decimal point, such as geographic coordinates or the results of computations).\nThere actually aren’t that many pure numbers in the granular datasets that we obtain via FOIA – dollar values and test measurements, for example. In R, as in most programming languages, trying to put text into a column defined as numbers will yield an error or a missing value.\nLogical: This is a subset of text. It can take one of only two values – yes or no, true or false. There is no “maybe”.\nDate and time: These are actual dates on the calendar, which have magical properties. You see a date or time that makes sense to you, but the computer sees a pure number. A date value in R is the number of days since Jan. 1, 1970; in Excel, it’s the number of days since Jan 1 1900. There are different date and time systems, but the lubridate package in R will handle most of them. The key to date values is that if they are stored as a date, they will sort correctly even though “February” comes before “January” in the alphabet. They also have attributes that you can extract, like the day of the week."

    "text": "12.3 Real world non-tidy data\nWickham laid out several ways that we see data when it’s not tidy. The three most common are:\n\nColumn headings are values, not variables. When a column heading shows each year, it is showing the value of the year variable, not something separate. This happens most of the time when you obtain data that is intended for publication, not analysis.\nThis is the most common type of untidy data seen in newsrooms, because so many of our datasets come in the form of spreadsheets from sources or the government, or from printed tables in PDF documents that are converted into spreadsheets.\nMultiple variables are stored in one column. You have to decide what the important level of detail is: Full name, or first name and last name? More frequently, this is a problem in data that comes from the Census Bureau, which has columns that combine, for example, sex and age. (Male, 25-54 years old)3\nRows might contain different levels of detail. This also comes from getting printouts rather than original datasets, where subtotals and totals are shown in rows, not in a separate table. Again, this is most common in statistical reports intended for printing rather than for analysis.\nSeparate sheets for the same data. It’s common for government agencies to provide data with one page for each year, or one page for each county. These usually have to be stacked on top of one another.\n\nYour first instinct in creating your own database will likely have one or more of these problems.\nNow that you have some of the basic concepts, it’s time to put them into practice!"

The New York Times found a 7-year-old survey conducted by the Justice Department that allowed it to compare the data for major cities in a standalone graphic that it published later that year.\nWhen newer data reflecting departments’ makeup in 2012 was released a year later, Matt Apuzzo and I hoped it would show some differences. It didn’t. So we were left trying to find news in the data that was clearly of public interest.\nAfter matching up the demographics of police departments with their cities, I started sorting, filtering and Googling. Could there be news in the outliers on the list? Which departments most closely represented their communities? Which ones had unusually large gaps?\n\n\nChief William T. Riley III. Credit: Laura McDermott for The New York Times\n\nI quickly stumbled on telling anecdote to frame the story: Inkster, Mich. had one of the least representative departments in the country, and had recently hired a new police chief to help mend the department’s fraught relationship with its largely African-American community. Where had he come from? Selma, Ala., one of the most representative police departments in the nation. Interviews with the chief, William T. Riley III, suggested one reason for some cities’ disparities: there was no state or federal money to pay for training new police officers.\nThe story, “Police Chiefs, Looking to Diversity Forces, Face Structural Hurdles” helped explain the persistent gap between the makeup of police in some areas and the communities they served."

    "text": "14.3 filter rows\nfilter uses Boolean logic to allow quite sophisticated and powerful conditions to pick out just the rows you want to see or to further examine.\nWhen you use a filter, you are telling R: “Give me back only the rows where the conditional formula I give you results in TRUE.”\nTry it yourself: In your Console, type your name in quotes, then two = signs, then “Barack Obama” in quotes. Note that the answer is FALSE – that condition fails.\nThe conditions are case-sensitive and extremely picky about characteristics like upper and lower case, spacing and punctuation. For example, “PIZZA HUT OF ARIZONA, INC” is completely different than “PIZZA HUT” or “Pizza Hut of Arizona Inc” . A simple extra character will prevent a match.[^That’s why I’ve removed all of the punctuation from your the borrower names and addresses in your data file, and turned all of the names into upper case.]\nHere are the operators , or symbols, you’ll use to make the conditions you want to test. Your column name goes on the left, and the value you want to test is on the right:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nData types\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n==\nAll\nEquals, exactly. Note the double-equals sign, which distinguishes it from an assignment operator, such as setting new column name.\n\n\n&gt; , &gt;=\ndate, numeric\nGreater than / greater than or equal to.\n\n\n&lt;, &lt;=\ndate, numeric\nLess than / less than or equal to.\n\n\n!=\nall\nNot equal to\n\n\n%in%\nall\nIs equal to any of the items in a list that you type out, such as fruit %in% c(\"apple\", \"orange\").\n\n\n\n\nIn each of these cases, the column name goes on the left of the operator, and the condition goes on the right.\nYou can combine them using the Boolean operators and and or, which are used in other contexts like advanced Google searches :\n\n& means “and”. which means that both conditions must be true. It narrows your search. (You can also separate the conditions with commas instead of ampersands) Think of it as a fish net, with smaller openings so only littler fish can geth through.\n| (the verticle bar, near the Return key) means “or” , which means that either condition can be true. It widens your search. It is a fish net with bigger openings, so both big and little fish can get through.\n%in% is the equivalent of an “or” condition and is used when you want to test a lot of items within one column but reduce the amount of repetitive typing.\n\nThis is sometimes confusing because it’s the exact opposite of the way we describe it in English. If we want “apples and oranges”, we have to search for an apple OR an orange in each row: fruit == 'apple' | fruit == 'orange'\nYou often need to use parentheses to tell R what order you want to evaluate the conditions when you combine “AND” and “OR” conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMatching parentheses can be tricky. To make it a little easier, you can set “rainbow parentheses” in the RStudio options, which will show you the matching opening or closing brackets and parentheses in different colors when your cursor is placed next to one of them. It’s under the Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Code -&gt; at the bottom of the Display tab.\n\n\n\nA few examples\nIn the PPP data, all borrower names are in upper case, and all cities and addresses are in proper case.

Instead, you can put them in a list and look for them all at once, like in this query where we look for Flagstaff, Sedona and Bisbee\n\nppp_small |&gt; \n  filter ( borrower_city %in% \n             c(\"Flagstaff\", \"Sedona\", \"Bisbee\")\n           )\n\n\n\nNarrowed to under $100,000\nTo narrow it just to loans under $100,000, you can use an “&” condition, or add another filter. In practice, I will often try to separate my “AND” conditions into a new filter command — it’s sometimes easier to read than a lot of (|&,) symbols.\n\nppp_small |&gt;\n  filter ( borrower_city %in% c(\"Flagstaff\", \"Sedona\")) |&gt;\n  filter ( amount &lt; 100000) |&gt;\n  arrange (date_approved)\n\n\n\nAnother way to do the same thing\nThe query above is the equivalent of the last example to produce the same answer. This time it uses a combination of the | “or” operator with the & “and” operator.\n\nppp_small |&gt;\n  filter ( \n           (borrower_city == \"Flagstaff\" | borrower_city == \"Sedona\") &\n            amount &lt; 10000\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange (date_approved)\n\n(You might note how I did the indentations above – it helps in reading the code to make clear what comes before what.)\n\n\nProjects in Maricopa County that are NOT in Phoenix or Scottsdale\nHere’s how to negate a filter - everything NOT in two cities. The ! at the beginning of the condition means that it must evaluate to FALSE instead of TRUE to be kept in the data.\n\nppp_small |&gt;\n  filter ( project_county == \"MARICOPA\" &\n             (! borrower_city %in% c(\"Scottsdale\", \"Phoenix\")) \n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange (amount)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBe careful when using missing data or combining conditions when you negate. The answer is often very different than you intended. It often behaves opposite of what you intended."

    "text": "14.4 Using str_like() for inexact matches\nThe operators we’ve examined so far are pretty limited. You have to know exactly what’s in a character column, which can get pretty annoying when you are trying to nail down a story based on data entered by humans into computers.\nBut you can also use the results of formulas, or expressions as a condition, as long as they result in a TRUE or FALSE answer. One of the most powerful is the function str_like(), which was added to the tidyverse in late 2022. It allows you to use wildcard characters to find words and phrases that begin with or contain some characters, and it’s not case-sensitive!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere is a whole set of these “string” functions available in the tidyverse through its stringr package. We’ll get to some of the more common ones later in the book, especially those related to a powerful pattern-matching method called “regular expressions” or “regex”.\n\n\nThe difference in using functions is that you’ll structure your command a little differently. Instead of\nborrower_city == \"Scottsdale\", you’ll use a formula that looks like\nstr_like(borrower_city, \"scottsdale\"), where the function name comes first, then, inside parentheses, are the column you want to check and the value you want to look for.\nstr_like() uses wildcards to stand in for characters you’re not sure about. They are:\n\n_ for one missing character. Use it when you aren’t sure of spelling.\nThe condition summari_e would be TRUE if the word were “summarise” or “summarize”.\n% for any number of unknown characters, or a missing character.\nFor example, N% SCOTTSDALE R% would match “North Scottsdale Road”, “N. Scottsdale Rd” or “North Scottsdale Rd.” but not “Scottsdale” or “N Scottsdale Ave”.\n\nSmart use of wildcards can often save you a lot of typing!\n\nExamples\nYou might want to use str_like whenever you filter for words just because it doesn’t care about upper and lower case.\nThis example would find borrowers who had addresses that were “CENTRAL AVE”, “Central Ave” or “central ave”. It excludes anyone with a street address, a suite number, or anyone on North Central Ave. because there is no wildcard:\n\nppp_small |&gt; \n  filter ( str_like ( borrower_address, \"central ave\"))\n\nBut this one finds all of the borrowers on Central Avenue:\n\nppp_small |&gt; \n  filter ( str_like ( borrower_address, \"% central ave%\") )\n\nIf you examine some of the answers, you’ll see why having wildcards is so important — there’s really no way to guess how, exactly, a borrower might have entered their address. There’s no standardization on this or on many other columns in the data."

In this case, the forgiveness amount never shows the value zero. Instead, it shows NA, or the R symbol for missing data.\nThis isn’t the same as the letters “NA”. It’s a special type of value that means “nothing”. It’s not zero, it’s not higher or lower than any other value, it doesn’t ever equal anything and it doesn’t ever NOT equal anything! It stands for a value that is truly unknown. In fact, an NA never even matches another NA, because we don’t know anything about either one.\nThis means you can’t filter for NA values directly and often have to take them into account.\nTo filter for NA values, you’ll use a special function — is.na() — designed to pick out these bad actors:\n\nppp_small |&gt; \n  filter ( is.na ( forgiveness_amount ))\n\nWe’ll come back to this later, but for now just remember that missing data is a scourge on your analysis, and it will almost always be a problem you have to solve."

Many of the expressions and functions are the same, so if they don’t look familiar to you, consider reviewing that chapter (again) first.\n\n\nmutate uses the syntax:\n    mutate ( new_column_name = function (arguments))\nThat’s pretty abstract, so we’ll do this using examples.\n\nMath on columns: compute difference and percent difference\nHere’s an example of computing the difference and percent difference between the amount received and the amount forgiven. Before you run this, try to think of why a reporter might be interested in this list.\nUse the single “=” sign to provide a name for the new column and create more than one new column using a comma between them:\n\nppp_orig |&gt;\n  mutate ( amt_diff =  forgiveness_amount-amount, \n           amt_pct_diff = amt_diff / amount  * 100 ) |&gt;                   # compute new columns\n  select ( borrower_name, borrower_city, amount, forgiveness_amount) |&gt;   # pick out a few columns\n  head(5).                                                                # show the first five rows\n\nIf you look hard enough, you’ll realize that there are a lot of rows with NA instead of a value. That’s because whenever you do anything with a missing value, the result is missing. Missing values infect everything they touch. You often have to deal with them before you can do anything else.\n\n\nConverting NA to 0\nWe would like to convert the forgiven amount from a missing value to zero, under the idea that if they have not filled it out, nothing has (yet) been forgiven. Of course, we’d have to check that with the SBA before publication.\nThere is a specific function used for that: replace_na(), with two arguments: The column you want to check for missing values, and the value you want to use instead. This isn’t limited to numbers – you can do the same thing with words, often replacing NA with “Unknown”.\n\nppp_forgiven_fixed &lt;- \n  ppp_orig |&gt;\n  mutate (amount_forgiven = replace_na(forgiveness_amount, 0))\n\n(Note that nothing came out in this code chunk because the result was saved into a new data frame variable.)\n\n\nDetail and total with summary statistics\nYou can use mutate to put summary statistics next to your values so you can see whether or not they are similar to the average or median.

For example, the business_type column has 24 different values, including NA . Here’s a list with the number of loans in each category:\n\n#| label: print-forgiven\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: false \n\nppp_forgiven_fixed  |&gt;\n   count ( business_type, sort=TRUE, name=\"# of rows\") \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nOne way to work with these is to create new columns with yes-no indicators for certain types of businesses like non-profits or individuals vs. companies.\n\nTwo categories using if_else\nThe function to do this is if_else() , which tests a condition exactly the same way filter did, but then assigns a value based on whether it’s met or not. You list the condition first, then a comma , then what should happen if the condition is true, and then what should happen if it’s false.\nThe condition is done the same way you did it in a filter, but instead of picking out the rows that match, mutate acts on them separately from the rows that don’t match.\nThere’s no “maybe”, except for NA’s in the original value. Here’s the general form of what it looks like:\n\nnew_column_name = if_else ( test the old column for something as in a a filter,\n                         give it a value if it's true,\n                         give it another value if it's not true)\nSo here is a way to do this with the business_type using the same %in% operator you used in the filter lesson, saving it to new data frame in your Environment, then displaying the first 10 types of businesses using count()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis code chunk uses a verb called count() to count up the number of rows in each category. We’ll get into this in much more detail in the next chapter, but it’s helpful to use it now to show you the results of creating new categories from old data.\n\n\n\n#| label: m-category-indiv \n#| eval: true \n#| echo: true\n\nppp_category_indiv &lt;- \n  ppp_forgiven_fixed |&gt;\n  mutate ( is_individual = \n              if_else ( business_type %in% \n                          c(\"Independent Contractors\", \n                            \"Sole Proprietorship\", \n                            \"Self-Employed Individuals\", \n                            \"Single Member LLC\"), \n                        \"Individual\", \n                        \"Organization\")\n  )  \n\nppp_category_indiv |&gt; \n  count (is_individual, business_type) |&gt; \n  head(10)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nTwo categories using fuzzy matching\nYou can also use the same str_like() function you used in filtering. Here, it sets whether or not the borrower was a non-profit. Remember, a % means “anything or nothing, and a _ means”any single character but it must be present”. In our case, the word is shown as “Non Profit” and “Non-Profit”. Once. you’ve set it to your new words, you can just filter on the new value:\n\nppp_category_nonprofit &lt;-\n  ppp_category_indiv |&gt;\n  mutate ( is_nonprofit = \n             if_else ( str_like(business_type, \"%Non_Profit%\") , \n                       \"Is nonprofit\", \n                       \"Not nonprofit\"))  \n\n\n\nppp_category_nonprofit |&gt;\n  count ( business_type, is_nonprofit) |&gt;\n  filter ( is_nonprofit == \"Is nonprofit\")\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(The profit categorization is unclear for some of these types, such as professional associations , tribal concerns and cooperatives.)\n\n\nMore than two categories using case_when()\nSometimes you will want more than one outcome, such as setting a value for “High”, “Medium” and “Low”. Instead of if_then, use the function case_when, which lets you string along conditions and their outcomes. The tilde (~) is used to show what happens if it’s true, and a TRUE at the end lets you say “everthing else”1\n\noriginal data |&gt; \n  case_when ( first condition ~ what if it's true,\n              second condition ~ what if  it's true, \n              third condition  ~ what if it's true, \n              TRUE ~ what to do with everything that's left\n              )"

Instead of using str_like(), with its limited wildcards, this is based on regular expressions, which we’ll look at later. But the way it’s used here is to separate words that might be in the description with “|”, for “OR”.\n\n\n\nSave it for use in another program\nSaving this for future use means you don’t have to worry anymore about some of the missing values, and you can filter and group by the simpler new business type instead of the original. This saves a data file called ppp_edited.RDS in your project folder.\n\nsaveRDS(ppp_business_categories, file=\"ppp_edited.RDS\")"

It removes the original columns completely, and only produces the summary statistics you compute within that statement. Using summarize alone produces a data frame with one row. It’s the equivalent of putting nothing in your pivot table in Excel other than the “Values” area.\nAnother way to think of summarize is that it collapses your list of items (loans, in our example) into a statistical report.\n\nThe dreaded NA\nYou saw in the mutate section that missing values are always a problem. Because they’re unknown, they can’t match anything else, they can’t be considered 0, and they can warp any answers you get. But there’s usually nothing you can do about missing data, so you have to tell the program exactly what to do about them.\nThere are two choices:\n\nLet them infect everything they touch, turning everything into NA. In this scenario, a total of the dollar values in a column would be NA if any of the values in that column is missing:\n\n\nppp_orig |&gt; \n  summarize ( sum(forgiveness_amount))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nIgnore them in a computation completely, effectively removing that value from your calculation. Be careful with this - it means that two summary statistics (say,n() and sum()) could be using a different set of rows!\n\nThere’s no right answer, and it depends on what you’re doing. In some cases, you know that they stand for the value 0, and in others you don’t. We will usually ignore them by adding an argument to every summary function that could be infected by them : na.rm = TRUE , which means, “remove NA’s before you do anything.”.\n\n\n\nSummary functions\nSome of the common functions you’ll use to summarize are :\n\nmean (column_name, na.rm=T) – for an average : Numbers only\nsum (column_name, na.rm = T): Numbers only\nn() – for “how many”, or “count”. Anything - this counts rows, not values\nn_distinct ( column_name) : The number of unique entries in the column. Use it to see how many categories there are in a column.\nmedian (column_name, na.rm=T): Numbers only\nmin (column_name, na.rm=T): Dates and numbers\nmax (column_name , na.rm=T): Dates and numbers\n\nWhen used on the whole data frame, it’s customary to just glimpse the output, since there’s only one row:\n\nppp_orig |&gt; \n  summarize ( n(), \n              mean (amount, na.rm=T), \n              mean (forgiveness_amount, na.rm=T), \n              min (date_approved, na.rm=T), \n              max (date_approved, na.rm= T), \n              n_distinct ( business_type)\n  ) |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 1\nColumns: 6\n$ `n()`                                 &lt;int&gt; 169259\n$ `mean(amount, na.rm = T)`             &lt;dbl&gt; 73206.66\n$ `mean(forgiveness_amount, na.rm = T)` &lt;dbl&gt; 77050.41\n$ `min(date_approved, na.rm = T)`       &lt;date&gt; 2020-04-03\n$ `max(date_approved, na.rm = T)`       &lt;date&gt; 2021-06-29\n$ `n_distinct(business_type)`           &lt;int&gt; 24\n\n\nThis produced a data frame with 1 row and 5 columns. The column names are the same as the formulas that created them, which is difficult to work with. Create new column names using the name (in back-ticks if it’s got spaces or special characters) and assign them the values of the summaries using the = sign:\n\nppp_orig |&gt; \n  summarize ( number_of_rows =  n(), \n              mean_amount = mean (amount, na.rm=T),    \n              median_amount = median (amount, na.rm=T),\n              mean_forgiven = mean (forgiveness_amount, na.rm=T),   # doesn't count the missing as zero!\n              first_loan = min (date_approved, na.rm=T),   \n              last_loan = max (date_approved, na.rm= T), \n              business_type_count = n_distinct(business_type)\n  ) |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 1\nColumns: 7\n$ number_of_rows      &lt;int&gt; 169259\n$ mean_amount         &lt;dbl&gt; 73206.66\n$ median_amount       &lt;dbl&gt; 20800\n$ mean_forgiven       &lt;dbl&gt; 77050.41\n$ first_loan          &lt;date&gt; 2020-04-03\n$ last_loan           &lt;date&gt; 2021-06-29\n$ business_type_count &lt;int&gt; 24\n\n\n\n\nGrouping\nNow that you know how to summarize the whole data frame, you’ll want to start getting totals by category. This is the same thing as a pivot table – the column names that create the “groups” are the equivalent of the Rows area a spreadsheet pivot table:\n\n\nGrouping by one column\nIn the PPP data, the “draw” refers to which of the two programs was involved - the original one, or the one passed by Congress in late 2020.\nHere’s how we’d get some key statistics by draw:\n\nppp_orig |&gt;\n  group_by ( draw ) |&gt;\n  summarize ( first_loan = min ( date_approved ), \n              total_amount = sum (amount), \n              total_forgiven = sum (forgiveness_amount, na.rm=T), \n              `# of loans` = n() \n  )\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nHere are a couple of things to note about grouped output:\n\nThe only columns saved are the ones that are shown in either the group_by or summarize rows. All of the other original columns have been eliminated. You no longer have them to work with .\n\nThe names of the columns for the summary statistics are the ones defined before the “=” sign in the summarize statement.\nTRAP! Don’t ever name your summary columns the same thing as a group_by column. It will override those names, and your output will be unintelligible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming your columns\n\n\n\nNote that the name of the columns doesn’t always follow our standard. In this case, # of loans has a special character and spaces. In order to create or use it, you must enclose them in back-tics (`) or you’ll get an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand your table to a new window\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re using visual mode, the table that gets produced can be really squished. To see more of it, pop it out into its own window using the leftmost button. 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrouping by more than one column\nIf you wanted to know the numbers outstanding and forgiven by draw, you could add another column to the group by:\n\nppp_orig |&gt;\n  group_by ( loan_status, draw ) |&gt;\n  summarize ( first_loan = min ( date_approved ), \n              total_amount = sum (amount), \n              total_forgiven = sum (forgiveness_amount, na.rm=T), \n              loan_ct = n() \n  )\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe summarize verb here has created a data frame that has only the variables you identified in the group_by and summarize commands - everything else has been removed, since it’s a summary of your data.\n\n\n\nA shortcut : count()\nIf all you want to do is count or add by group, you can use the count() function as a shortcut. It does the exact same thing as a combination of group_by() and summarize( n() ) and arrange()` to get the number of items in each category, sorted by the most frequent to least:\n\nppp_orig |&gt; \n  count ( loan_status, draw, \n          sort=TRUE,\n          name = \"loans\")"

    "text": "16.2 Using and converting groups\n\nConverting from long to wide data\nTypically, if you want to just look at your data, you’d want to see one of the columns down the side (rows in pivot tables), and another across the top (columns in pivot tables). Helpfully, a new verb called pivot_wider() does just that – pivots your data from long to wide.\nStart with a simple query with two grouping columns (note that I’ve called the number of loans loan_ct, so it’s easier to work with later on.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nThis is really hard to read. Turn it on its head with pivot_wider():\n\nNormally, you’ll only want to have one summary statistic shown in a rectangle, with one column spread across the top and another column shown in rows. In R, this is done by “pivoting” your tables. There are a lot of advanced options in pivot functions that let you show more than one statistic at a time, and tell R how to name them. There will be a chapter later on that addresses a lot of the problems you have in reading tables, so we’ll put that off for now.\nHere’s an explanation of what the command looks like.\n\n\npivot_wider ( id_cols = *list of columns to keep down the side* , \n                names_from = *the name of the column supplying the headings across the top*, \n                values_from = *the values you want to show in each cell* , \n                values_fill = *what you want to show if it's empty, usually 0 *\n                )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYour instinct will often be that you want to see your data in this form, but you can and should actually do most of your work without it. This is a core concept of the tidyverse, which is detailed in this chapter’s last section. But even if you don’t look at that part, remember that pivoting to a “wide” format is usually your last step, not one of your first.\n\n\n\n\nTotals and subtotals\nYou noticed that when you created the summaries, there was no option to create a “percent of total” such as the percent of loans in each draw, or the percent of money that had been forgiven.\nYou can use summary functions outside a summarize statement! This means that you can compute the percent of total, the same way you used an option in pivot tables. This took me a long time to understand, so try to slow down, and just try it a few times! When you look carefully at your output, you’ll start to understand it better.\nThe trick is to summarize, then use mutate to add a column with the percentages made out of totals:\n\nppp_orig |&gt;\n  group_by ( draw) |&gt;\n  summarize ( loan_count = n() ) |&gt;\n  mutate ( all_loans = sum (loan_count), \n           pct_of_total = loan_count / all_loans * 100\n           )\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if you have more than one group?\nThis is where the idea of grouped data gets a little confusing. It depends on exactly how you did your summarize statement. But if you use the default mechanism, the “all_loans” is the subtotal. The default behavior is that the “groups” are kept for all but the last column listed in the group_by statement, meaning any summaries you do off of the data will refer to the subtotal.\n\nppp_orig |&gt;\n  group_by ( draw, loan_status) |&gt;\n  summarize ( loan_count = n() ) |&gt;\n  mutate ( loans_in_draw = sum (loan_count),\n           pct_of_draw = loan_count / loans_in_draw * 100)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nHere’s a pretty typical way to do this: Create a subtotal, use it for your percentages, then pivot the percentages:\n\nppp_orig |&gt; \n  group_by ( draw, loan_status) |&gt; \n  summarize ( loan_count = n() ) |&gt; \n  mutate ( loans_in_draw = sum(loan_count), \n           pct_of_draw = loan_count / loans_in_draw * 100 ) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider ( \n    id_cols = c(draw, loans_in_draw), \n    names_from = loan_status, \n    values_from = pct_of_draw,\n    values_fill = 0)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNow you can easily compare the outcome by draw, by reading across to reach 100% and reading down to compare them.\nWe’ll have a whole chapter / week on making good tables that are readable and understandable. For now, just remember that it’s always possible to turn a data frame on its head, and that you can compute much of what you need BEFORE you do that."

    "text": "16.4 Understanding grouped data\nYou may have noticed an odd warning after you run the code with multiple grouping columns, for example:\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'loan_status'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.\" \n\n\nWhat does that mean?\nWhen you grouped by loan status and draw, R effectively split up your data frame into five independent and completely divorced piles - one for each combination of draw and loan status that it found. It processed them one by one to create the output data frame that was printed out.\nAfter it’s done summarizing your data, R doesn’t know what you want to do with the piles – keep them, or put everything back together again.\nBy default, after you group by more than one column, it maintains the separate piles for all but the last group in your list under group_by – in this case the loan_status. Here, everything you do after this will work on three piles separately.The message tells you what it did with the piles, and how to change that behavior.\nThe documentation of grouped data provides details of how each of the tidyverse’s verbs handle grouped data.\nHere’s what a “glimpse()” looks like for a data frame that has retained some groups:\n\nppp_orig |&gt; \n  select ( loan_status, date_approved:amount) |&gt; \n  group_by ( loan_status) |&gt; glimpse()\n\nRows: 169,259\nColumns: 11\nGroups: loan_status [3]\n$ loan_status      &lt;chr&gt; \"Paid in Full\", \"Paid in Full\", \"Paid in Full\", \"Paid…\n$ date_approved    &lt;date&gt; 2020-04-10, 2020-04-11, 2020-04-11, 2020-04-29, 2020…\n$ draw             &lt;chr&gt; \"First\", \"First\", \"First\", \"First\", \"First\", \"First\",…\n$ borrower_name    &lt;chr&gt; \"SFE HOLDINGS LLC\", \"NAVAJO TRIBAL UTILITY AUTHORITY\"…\n$ borrower_address &lt;chr&gt; \"9366 East Raintree Drive\", \"Po Box 170\", \"2999 N44th…\n$ borrower_city    &lt;chr&gt; \"Scottsdale\", \"Fort Defiance\", \"Phoenix\", \"Tucson\", \"…\n$ borrower_state   &lt;chr&gt; \"AZ\", \"AZ\", \"AZ\", \"AZ\", \"AZ\", \"AZ\", \"AZ\", \"AZ\", \"AZ\",…\n$ borrower_zip     &lt;chr&gt; \"85260\", \"86504\", \"85018\", \"85711\", \"85250\", \"85012\",…\n$ franchise_name   &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ loan_status_date &lt;date&gt; 2021-08-17, 2022-02-05, 2021-09-25, 2021-08-21, 2021…\n$ amount           &lt;dbl&gt; 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 100…\n\n\nNotice the “Groups” row at the top – that tells you it’s got three piles, defined by the loan_status column.\n\n\nGetting rid of the message\nYou can do three things to get rid of the message. I suggest the first of these, since it makes you explicitly decide what to do each time, depending on your goal:\n\nAdd a .groups=... argument that looks like this at the end of the summarize statement. This example tells R to do what it does by default, with no warning:\n\n\nppp_orig |&gt;\n  group_by ( loan_status, draw ) |&gt;\n  summarize ( `# of loans` = n() , \n              .groups = \"drop_last\"\n  )\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe other possibilities are : .groups=\"drop\" and \".groups=\"keep\" (Note the period before the word “groups”. I have no idea why, but sometimes options are indicated this way.)\n\nSuppress all messages either for the whole document or for the code chunk. Here’s what your YAML would look like if you added message: false to it. (This has the benefit of suppressing a lot of other annoying messages that you might not care about as well):\n\n\n\ntitle: \"YOUR TITLE - CHANGE THIS\"\nauthor: \"YOUR NAME - CHANGE THIS\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    code-tools: true\n    embed-resources: true\n    df-print: paged\n    page-layout: full\nexecute: \n  message: false\n\n\nAdd a line to your setup chunk, changing the default behavior through the systemwide options:\noptions(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)\n\n\n\nTidy data and “long” vs. “wide” use in groups\n\nLike families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\n– Hadley Wickham, with apologies to Leo Tolstoy\n\nThe concept of tidy data was outlined by Hadley Wickham in a seminal paper nearly a decade ago, which defined a specific way of organizing data values within a dataset. .Wickham argues that by following the principle, you know how you would LIKE your data to be organized, and don’t have to figure it out every time you encounter a new dataset. But a lot of people have trouble internalizing the concepts of tidy data. Once you do, everything else we’re doing in this book makes more sense.\n\nEach column is a “variable”, in that it defines a single attribute, such as height, weight, or zip code.\nEach row an “observation”, which contains all values of the variables measured on the same unit (say, person)\nEach “value” (usually number, text or date) belongs to a variable and an observation – it lies in the intersection of the two, and is seen in a cell.\nEach dataset, or spreadsheet, or data frame, refers to a different type of unit. There would be one for people, another for traffic tickets and a third for vehicles. These are the nouns that we’ve talked so much about.\n\nOur PPP data starts in tidy form, but we converted it to un-tidy data by pivoting it.\n\nReal world non-tidy data\nWickham laid out several ways that we see data when it’s not tidy. The three most common are:\n\nColumn headings are values, not variables. When a column heading shows each year, it is showing the value of the year variable, not something separate. This happens most of the time when you obtain data that is intended for publication, not analysis.\nMultiple variables are stored in one column. This can be taken too far, but you have to decide what the important level of detail is: Full name, or first name and last name? It can also come in data like the Census Bureau, where a value might represent both an age and a gender. (Male, 25-54 years old )\nRows might contain different levels of detail. This also comes from getting printouts rather than original datasets, where subtotals and totals are shown in rows, not in a separate table. We have talked about the noun represented by each row – it should always be the same, so students and schools shouldn’t be in the same table; schools and school districts should be separated.\n\n\n\nWhat does this have to do with grouped data?\nGrouped data effectively breaks out values of categories and treats them independently, which is the equivalent of temporarily treating them as their own column.\nIt’s somewhat difficult in the tidyverse to summarize across columns – it really wants to summarize rows. In a spreadsheet, it’s just as easy to write an =sum(B1:J1) as it is =sum(B1:B12). But the tidyverse is only expecting you do to the second version (rows B1:b12), not the first. The reason is that it would make no sense to sum truly different variables (like adding up income and house price)!\nIt means that in our R journey so far, grouped data is the first place you would have encountered situations in which your instinct is to wreck a perfectly good dataset.\nWe’ll come back to all of that, but just remember that it’s possible to do all kinds of computations within a group that you’d normally think you want to do across columns. One example is, say, the change in COVID cases by county. Computing monthly percent changes would look something like this using the lag() function to get the previous row. This assumes the “tidy” data looks something like this:\n\n\n\nstate\ncounty\nmonth\ncases\n\n\n\n\nAL\nAuburn\n2020-04-01\n24\n\n\nAL\nAuburn\n2020-05-01\n35\n\n\nAL\nAuburn\n2020-06-01\n200\n\n\n\ncovid_data |&gt;\n  group_by (state, county) |&gt; \n  arrange (month) |&gt; \n  mutate ( change = cases - lag(cases) , \n           pct_change = change / lag(cases) * 100 ) \nThis method will start over for each county, so it will be NA for the first month within each county.\n(Your instinct may have been to pivot the data to show each month in its own column, then compute the percent change on each of those columns – something that could get really old really quickly. )\nThis is just one example of how grouped data is quite powerful when used correctly. There are many others, such as extracting the most recent event in a court history by case. Try to think about how one group would be computed, and then don’t worry how the rest will work – R will do that thinking for you."

    "text": "17.1 Join basics and relational databases\nHere is a great explainer on joins made by a previous MAIJ student, Andy Blye. Be sure to watch it:\n\njoining in computer programming matches columns in one table to another, where the values within one or more columns match exactly. Here’s an example from Jenny Bryan’s Stat 545 course textbook:\n\n\n\n\nsuperheroes\n\n\n\n\nRelational databases\nMost large data systems created since the 1980s are called “relational databases”, which means that each unit (person, ticket, vehicle) is stored in a different table2, and common columns link them together. They also routinely use codes or shorthand to store data, and provide another table to “look up” the details.\nFor example, your student ID is stored in one place in the university system with your name, address, email address, etc. When you sign up for courses, the database looks up that information to attach to your schedule. You only have to change it in one place, and it is automatically sent out through all of the interactions you have with the university.\nSimilarly, the course number, section and term is all that needs to be stored in the system for any semester. Those data points then populate the name of the course, the students registered for it, and holidays.\nThe system is created this way because it’s more efficient and reliable. Important information is stored only once, and can then be applied to millions of rows.\nExamples of relational databases include:\n\nCampaign finance systems, where donors are stored in one table and candidates in another, linked through a candidate or political action committee id.\nInspection records, such as those for restaurants, hospitals, housing code violations and workplace safety, which typically have at least three tables: The establishment (like a restaurant or a workplace), an inspection (an event on a date), and a violation (something that they found). Each table has its own ID, which is used whenever they are linked together.\nA court docket data system, which usually has many types of rows: A master case table links to information on charges, defendants, lawyers, sentences and court hearings.\n\nThis conforms to the tidy data principles that you examined in the last chapter.\nUsually, you will have what is known as a “1-to-many” join. That is, there are many instances of a value in one table’s column, but just one instance of it in the lookup or related table. The superheroes example above is one of those instances: There are many entries for DC comics in the superhero table, but just one in the publisher table.\nIf this isn’t true, you will have what is known as “many-to-many” joins, which is, in layman’s terms, a bowl of tangled spaghetti. Each match will be duplicated the number of times it is in the related table. Experts call this a cartesian join, and it’s usually bad.\n\n\njoin syntax\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere are actually pretty good explanations of the concept of joining and the variations of it in R in the documentation.\n\n\nThere are several kinds of joins, but the syntax is similar across them.\n  old_table |&gt;\n     inner_join (new_table , \n     join_by = (name of old_table column == name of new_table column) )\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTry to piece together what this is saying, similar to the filter conditions: If the two columns are equal (double-equal signs), put them together.\n\n\n\nTypes of joins\n\nAn inner_join means that the value(s) in the common columns must match in BOTH tables – it will eliminate any row without a match\nA left_join or right_join keeps everything from one table, and only the information that matches from the other. Those columns will contain NA wherever the match fails.\nA full_join puts together both tables no matter whether there is any match. It’s pretty rare to use this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe new version of the join verb has a lot of new capabilities, including “fuzzy joins”, which let you get answers when they are almost the same. For now, we’re sticking with the standard way joins work across programming languages, but will come back to fuzzy matching later."

    "section": "17.2 Matchmaking with joins",
    "text": "17.2 Matchmaking with joins\n\nAttaching characteristics to a dataset\nYou’ll often want to learn more about a geographic area’s demographics, voting habits or other characteristics, and match it to other data. Sometimes it’s simple: Find the demographics of counties that switched from Trump to Biden as a way to isolate places you might want to visit. Another example from voting might be to find the precinct that has the highest percentage of Latino citizens in the county, then match that precinct against the voter registration rolls to get a list of people you might want to interview on election day. In these instances, the join is used as a filter, but it comes from a different table. .\nThis is also common when you have data by zip code or some other geography, and you want to find clusters of interesting potential stories, such as PPP loans in minority neighborhoods.\n\n\nSummarize data against another dataset\nThe previous examples all result in lists of potential story people or places. If you use join on summarized data, you can characterize a broad range of activity across new columns. Simplified, this is how you can write that more PPP money went to predominantly white neighborhoods than those that were majority Black.\n\n\n“Enterprise” joins\nInvestigative reporters often use joins in ways unintended by the data creators. In the 1990s, they dubbed these “enterprise” joins, referring to the enterprising reporters who thought of them. In these instances, reporters combine datasets in ways that find needles in haystacks, such as:\n\nSchool bus drivers who have had tickets for driving while intoxicated.\nDay care center operators who are listed on the sex offender registry.\nDonors to a governor who got contracts from the state\n\nWhen you match these kinds of datasets, you will always have mistakes — some apparent matches are incorrect in the real world; some matches that should exist are ignored because of variations in names or other details. You always have to report out any suspected matches, so they are time consuming stories.\nIn the mid-2000s, when some politicians insisted that dead people were voting and proposed measures to restrict voting, almost every regional news organization sent reporters on futile hunts for the dead voters. They got lists of people on the voter rolls, then lists of people who had died through the Social Security Death Index or local death certificates. I never met anyone who found a single actual dead voter, but months of reporter-hours were spent tracking down each lead. Instead, they were people who had not yet been eliminated on the rolls but never voted. In others, they were people with the same names who had nothing to do with the dead person. In still others, they were the same people, but very much alive!\nIt’s very common for two people to have the same name in a city. In fact, it’s common to have two people at the same home with the same name – they’ve just left off “Jr.” and “Sr.” in the database. In this case, you’ll find matches that you shouldn’t. These are false positives, or Type I errors in statistics.\nWe rarely get dates of birth or Social Security Numbers in public records, so we have to join by name and sometimes location. If someone has moved, sometimes uses a nickname, or the government has recorded the spelling incorrectly, the join will fail – you’ll miss some of the possible matches. This is very common with company names, which can change with mergers and other changes in management, and can be listed in many different ways.\nThese are false negatives, or Type II errors in statistics.3\nIn different contexts, you’ll want to minimize different kinds of errors. For example, if you are looking for something extremely rare, and you want to examine every possible case – like a child sex offender working in a day care center – you might choose to make a “loose” match and get lots of false positives, which you can check. If you want to limit your reporting only to the most promising leads, you’ll be willing to live with missing some cases in order to be more sure of the joins you find.\nYou’ll see stories of this kind write around the lack of precision – they’ll often say, “we verified x cases of….” rather than pretend that they know of them all."

    "text": "17.3 Using lookup tables: PPP industry codes\nThe PPP data has a code called the naics_code, which is an industry coding system created by the Census to categorize all economic activity.\nWe’ll use a table that contains the list of industries and match it to the PPP data. (The lookup table was derived from the concordance package in R, but is fully explained at the Census website.)\n\nOnce you load these data frames, be sure to explore them a little to make sure you understand what they contain.\n\nThe following code chunk loads both the original PPP data and the code table:\n\nnaics_codes &lt;- readRDS( url ( \"https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/rdata/naics_lookup.RDS\"))\nppp_orig &lt;- readRDS (url ( \"https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/rdata/ppp_az_loans.RDS\"))\n\nglimpse(naics_codes)\n\nRows: 1,042\nColumns: 7\n$ naics_code     &lt;chr&gt; \"111110\", \"111120\", \"111130\", \"111140\", \"111150\", \"1111…\n$ sector_code    &lt;chr&gt; \"11\", \"11\", \"11\", \"11\", \"11\", \"11\", \"11\", \"11\", \"11\", \"…\n$ subsector_code &lt;chr&gt; \"111\", \"111\", \"111\", \"111\", \"111\", \"111\", \"111\", \"111\",…\n$ sector_desc    &lt;chr&gt; \"Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting\", \"Agricult…\n$ subsector_desc &lt;chr&gt; \"Crop Production\", \"Crop Production\", \"Crop Production\"…\n$ naics_desc     &lt;chr&gt; \"Soybean Farming\", \"Oilseed (except Soybean) Farming\", …\n$ naics_cronkite &lt;chr&gt; \"11 - Agriculture\", \"11 - Agriculture\", \"11 - Agricultu…\n\n\nNotice that the industry code is 7 characters long, and has a detailed description.

    "text": "17.4 Joining risks\n\njoining tl;dr\nThere are lots of risks in joining tables that you created yourself, or that were created outside a big relational database system. Keep an eye on the number of rows returned every time that you join – you should know what to expect.\n\n\nDouble counting with joins\nWe won’t go into this in depth, but just be aware it’s easy to double-count rows when you join. Here’s a made-up example, in which a zip code is on the border and is in two counties:\nSay you want to use some data on zip codes :\n\n\n\nzip code\ncounty\ninfo\n\n\n\n\n85232\nMaricopa\nsome data\n\n\n85232\nPinal\nsome more data\n\n\n\nand match it to a list of restaurants in a zip code:\n\n\n\nzip code\nrestaurant name\n\n\n\n\n85232\nMy favorite restaurant\n\n\n85232\nMy second-favorite restaurant\n\n\n\nWhen you match these, you’ll get 4 rows:\n\n\n\nzip code\ncounty\ninfo\nrestaurant name\n\n\n\n\n85232\nMaricopa\nsome data\nMy favorite restaurant\n\n\n85232\nPinal\nsome more data\nMy favorite restaurant\n\n\n85232\nMaricopa\nsome data\nMy second-favorite restaurant\n\n\n85232\nPinal\nsome more data\nMy second-favority restaurant\n\n\n\nNow, every time you try to count restaurants, these two will be double-counted.\nIn computing, this is called a “many-to-many” relationship – there are many rows of zip codes and many rows of restaurants. In journalism, we call it spaghetti. It’s usually an unintended mess.\n\n\nLosing rows with joins\nThe opposite can occur if you aren’t careful and there are items you want to keep that are missing in your reference table. If there were invalid NAICS codes in the original data, they would have been eliminated from the resulting joined table."

    "section": "18.1 Types of regular expression patterns",
    "text": "18.1 Types of regular expression patterns\n\nLiteral strings\nThese are just letters, like “abc” or “Mary”. They are case-sensitive and no different than using text in a filter.\nYou can tell the regex that you want to find your pattern at the beginning or end of a line:\n  ^   = \"Find only at the beginning of a line\"\n  $   = \"Find only at the end of a line\"\n\n\nWild cards\nA wild card is a character you use to indicate the word “anything”. Here are some ways to use wild cards in regex:\n    .      = \"any single character of any type\"\n    .?     = \"a possible single character of any type (but it might not exist)\"\n    .*     = \"anything or nothing of any length\"\n    .+     = \"anything one or more times\"\n    .{1,3} = \"anything running between 1 and 3 characters long\"\nRegular expressions also have wild cards of specific types. In R, they are “escaped” using two backslashes. In other languages and in the example https://regex101.com site they only use one backslash:\n      \\\\d   = \"Any digit\"\n      \\\\w   = \"Any word character\"\n      \\\\s   = \"Any whitespace (tab, space, etc.)\"\n      \\\\b   = \"Any word boundary\" (period, comma, space, etc.)\nWhen you upper-case them, it’s the opposite:\n      \\\\D = \"Anything but a digit\"\n\n\nCharacter classes\nSometimes you want to tell the regex what characters it is allowed to accept. For example, say you don’t know whether there is an alternative spelling for a name – you can tell the regex to either ignore a character, or take one of several.\nIn R, we saw that there were alternative spellings for words like “summarize” – the British and the American spellings. You could, for example, use this pattern to pick up either spelling:\n        summari[sz]e\nThe bracket tells the regex that it’s allowed to take either one of those characters. You can also use ranges:\n  [a-zA-Z0-9]\nmeans that any lower case, upper case or numeric character is allowed.\n\n\nEscaping\nBecause they’re already being used for special purposes, some characters have to be “escaped” before you can search for them. Notably, they are parentheses (), periods, backslashes, dollar signs, question marks, dashes and carets.\nThis means that to find a period or question mark, you have to use the pattern\n    \\\\. or\n    \\\\?\nIn the Regex101, this is the biggest difference among the flavors of regex – Python generally requires the least amount of escaping.\n\n\nMatch groups\nUse parentheses within a pattern to pick out pieces, which you can then use over again. The end of this chapter shows how to do this in R, which is a little complicated because we haven’t done much with lists."

We’ll skip that for now.\n\nSome other useful string functions are:\n\nTo convert the case, use str_to_lower(colname), str_to_upper(colname), or str_to_title()\n\nTo smush together phrases, use str_c() or paste() or paste0.\n\n\n\nConvert everything to lowercase\nOne strategy for using regular expressions is to convert everything to lower case before trying to match text.

It’s very useful in two situations:\n\nAs a filter for rows in your data.\nAs a way to assign values in an if_else() or case_when() expression, when creating a new column using mutate().\n\n\nExample 1: Filter for “biden”\n\ntrump_tweets |&gt; \n  select ( tweet_date, tweet_lowercase) |&gt; \n  filter (  str_detect ( tweet_lowercase, \"biden\"))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nBut that leaves out any time he’s called “sleepy joe”.

Otherwise, it doesn’t know how to interpret it: It could be (biden|sleepy) joe, which wouldn’t match much! )\n\n\nKeywords\nAnother way to look at these tweets is to look for signs of populism – words like “globalist” or “marxist”. Here’s one way to find a lot of them:\nThere are two or or three parts to a regular expression:\n\nThe pattern you are trying to find.\nAn optional replacement, which could use part of what you’ve found in the original seeking phase.\nOptions - the big one in R is negate=TRUE, which means to match everything EXCEPT what is found.\n\nIn practice, you’ll usually save the pieces of each pattern you’ve found into a variable, then put them back together differently.\nHere are two other good tutorials on regular expressions:\n\nFrom Justin Meyer at a recent IRE conference that can serve as a guide.\n\nFrom Prof. Christian McDonald of UT-Austin\nIf you’re using R, you can use a regex using the stringr package (part of the tidyverse) using the functions str_detect , str_extract and their cousins. They look like this:\n\n    str_detect(var_name, regex(\"pattern\")) \n\nThe vignette on the stringr package in the Tidyverse is reasonably helpful."

    "text": "19.4 Types of regular expression patterns\n\nLiteral strings\nThese are just letters, like “abc” or “Mary”. They are case-sensitive and no different than using text in a filter.\nYou can tell the regex that you want to find your pattern at the beginning or end of a line:\n  ^   = \"Find only at the beginning of a line\"\n  $   = \"Find only at the end of a line\"\n\n\nWild cards\nA wild card is a character you use to indicate the word “anything”. Here are some ways to use wild cards in regex:\n    .      = \"any single character of any type\"\n    .?     = \"a possible single character of any type (but it might not exist)\"\n    .*     = \"anything or nothing of any length\"\n    .+     = \"anything one or more times\"\n    .{1,3} = \"anything running between 1 and 3 characters long\"\nRegular expressions also have wild cards of specific types. In R, they are “escaped” using two backslashes. In other languages and in the example https://regex101.com site they only use one backslash:\n      \\\\d   = \"Any digit\"\n      \\\\w   = \"Any word character\"\n      \\\\s   = \"Any whitespace (tab, space, etc.)\"\n      \\\\b   = \"Any word boundary\" (period, comma, space, etc.)\nWhen you upper-case them, it’s the opposite:\n      \\\\D = \"Anything but a digit\"\n\n\nCharacter classes\nSometimes you want to tell the regex what characters it is allowed to accept. For example, say you don’t know whether there is an alternative spelling for a name – you can tell the regex to either ignore a character, or take one of several.\nIn R, we saw that there were alternative spellings for words like “summarize” – the British and the American spellings. You could, for example, use this pattern to pick up either spelling:\n        summari[sz]e\nThe bracket tells the regex that it’s allowed to take either one of those characters. You can also use ranges:\n  [a-zA-Z0-9]\nmeans that any lower case, upper case or numeric character is allowed.\n\n\nEscaping\nBecause they’re already being used for special purposes, some characters have to be “escaped” before you can search for them. Notably, they are parentheses (), periods, backslashes, dollar signs, question marks, dashes and carets.\nThis means that to find a period or question mark, you have to use the pattern\n    \\\\. or\n    \\\\?\nIn the Regex101, this is the biggest difference among the flavors of regex – Python generally requires the least amount of escaping.\n\n\nMatch groups\nUse parentheses within a pattern to pick out pieces, which you can then use over again. The end of this chapter shows how to do this in R, which is a little complicated because we haven’t done much with lists."

It’s a little hard to use unless your data is in just the right form.\nTableau Public, made mainly for business intelligence, but a free version is available. I haven’t used it for a while for a few reasons: Newsrooms don’t use it much because it doesn’t scale well to mobile; it’s hard to save drafts in the free version; it’s a little hard to get used to the interface for a quick visualization.\nThe underlying D3 language of graphics, which is written in Javascript, is what powers a lot of these products.

The details are unimportant, but it showed that this company began quite small and grew quite quickly — the characteristic we were seeking. The others were not as strong candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviewing two data points in a long list\n\n\n\nThis graphic shows the difference between the percent of businesses that got PPP loans in majority Latino zip codes compared to majority white non-Hispanic, based on four different measures. We used it at Reveal to identify places that might be the right place for a story – those where, across a series of measures, the difference was noticable, and the number of loans was large enough to warrant investigating. The team decided to center the story in Los Angeles, though it also reported on Dallas.\n\n\n\nText with graphics\nLooking at a table of numbers is mind-numbing. It’s hard to pick out what’s important. Some of the most imaginative visualizations come in the form of tables. In fact, there’s even a contest among R users to build the best tables. 1\nOne simple example is this analysis of federal prosecutions of gun charges over three administrations. We were curious: which statutes are the ones that Joe Biden is prioritizing compared with previous administrations? And was there a major downturn in prosecutions during the pandemic? These “sparklines” on the data table help show the trends, even when the numbers themselves are very different:\n\n\n\nNetworks of companies, people or programs\nThis is an example of a network analysis of Medicare charges among nephrologists – kidney doctors. We had heard that one consultant was showing doctors how to do procedures in their offices that were traditionally done in hospitals. The procedures had unusually high billing rates in doctors’ offices, but very low ones in hospital settings. These networks looked at the similarity across doctors’ practices by comparing the proportions of billing codes, then clustering them when they matched about 75 percent of the time. The area of red, large circles on the right turned out to be the same consulting practice. Sadly, the reporter who worked on this tip left the paper before we had a chance to publish."

    "text": "21.2 Tips for exploratory visualizations\n\nUse small multiples to quickly orient yourself in a large dataset\n“Small multiples” are repeated images, usually over time or place. This example shows where each round of agricultural disaster payments went, which helped us decide on where to focus our reporting – Kansas and North Dakota.\n\n\n\nLook at your data from all directions\nWhen you’re trying to understand a story or a dataset, there’s no wrong way to look at it; try it every way you can think of, and you’ll get a different perspective. If you’re reporting on crime, you might look at one set of charts with change in violent crimes in a year; another might be the percent change; the other might be a comparison to other cities; and another might be a change over time. Use raw numbers, percentages and indexes.\nLook at them on different scales. Try following the rule that the x-axis must be zero. Then break that rule and see if you learn more. Try out logarithms and square roots for data with odd distributions.\nKeep in mind the research done on visual perception. William Cleveland’s experiments showed that the eye sees change in an image when the average slope is about 45 degrees. This suggests you ignore the admonitions to always start at zero and instead work toward the most insightful graphic. Other research in epidemiology has suggested you find a target level as a boundary for your chart. Each of these ways helps you see the data in different ways. When they’ve stopped telling you anything new, you know you’re done.\n\n\nDon’t assume\nNow that you’ve looked at your data a variety of ways, you’ve probably found records that don’t seem right – you may not understand what they meant in the first place, or there are some outliers that seem like they are typos, or there are trends that seem backwards.\nIf you want to publish anything based on your early exploration or in a published visualization, you have to resolve these questions and you can’t make assumptions. They’re either interesting stories or mistakes; interesting challenges to common wisdom or misunderstanding.\nIt’s not unusual for local governments to provide spreadsheets filled with errors, and it’s also easy to misunderstand government jargon in a dataset.\nFirst, walk back your own work. Have you read the documentation, its caveats and does the problem exist in the original version of the data? If everything on your end seems right, then it’s time to pick up the phone. You’re going to have to get it resolved if you plan to use it, so you might as well get started now.\nThat said, not every mistake is important. In campaign finance records, it’s common to have several hundred postal codes that don’t exist in a database of 100,000 records. As long as they’re not all in the same city or within a candidate, the occasional bad data record just doesn’t matter.\nAsk yourself: if I were to use this, would readers have a fundamentally accurate view of what the data says?\n\n\nAvoid obsessiong over precision and presentation details\nThe flip side of not asking enough questions is obsessing over precision before it matters. Your exploratory graphics should be generally correct, but don’t worry if you have various levels of rounding, if they don’t add up to exactly 100 percent or if you are missing one or two years’ data out of 20. This is part of the exploration process. You’ll still see the big trends and know what you have to collect before it’s time for publication.\nIn fact, you might consider taking away labeling and scale markers, much like the charts above, to even better get an overall sense of the data.\n\n\nCreate chronologies of cases and events\nAt the start of any complex story, begin building chronologies of key events and cases. These are easily done in a spreadsheet or a data collection system like Airtable. You will eventually need one.\n\n\nMeet with designers and graphics editors early and often\nBrainstorm about possible graphics with the artists and designers in your newsroom. They will have good ways to look at your data, suggestions of how it might work interactively, and know how to connect data and stories. It will make your reporting much easier if you know what you have to collect early on, or if you can alert your team that a graphic isn’t possible when you can’t collect it."

There are several useful defaults for the whole table, such as the number format. One way to simplify the typing is to just create the names of the columns you want to see in a select statement, then put a default number format for the dollar amounts.

Conceptually, it follows the principles in Leland Wilkinson’s “Grammar of Graphics”, written in 1999 as a framework for thinking about visualizations. For our purposes, you just need to understand that any visualization is made up of several fundamental pieces. In ggplot2, they are:\n\naesthetics (called “aes”) : What data are you plotting? It can have more than two dimensions, such as x-axis, y-axis, a column used for color and another used for size. These are things we can see on a graphic, including the values.\ngeometry refers to the shape each column will take.\nscale - any transformation we might make.\nfacets - creating small multiples by splitting up one graph into many similar graphs, based on a variable.\nlayers - adding multiple geometries on top of one another to reveal new information, or add annoations.\n\nIf you’ve used Photoshop or other Adobe products, this idea of layering data, annotation, style and other elements will be familiar to you.\nOne quirk of ggplot is that instead of the %&gt;% pipe command , it uses + instead. There are technical reasons for this, but it’s not worth getting into…\nThe basic structure of the plot is:\n      ggplot (  data = df_name, \n                aes (\n                  x = column_name,\n                  y = column_name,\n                  fill = color inside color,\n                  color = border color,\n                  size = size if relevant\n                  )\n                ) +\n                a geometry (eg, geom_point, geom_bar, etc.) with options such as color, fill and size +\n                facet_wrap ( column ~ column ) +\n                any scale information\nWe’re going to skip the labeling and annotation parts for now. That would come under layering and legends. In practice, these options can be mixed througout the command."

We’re going to use a slightly different version of it to create the visualizations because an older version was matched to the Spotify database to extract certain information from each of the songs.\nThis data was used as a TidyTuesday dataset in 2021 (scroll down to get the data dictionaries), so it’s a little older than the one we worked on earlier.\nThis data has two tables:\n\nThe Hot 100 from mid-1958 to mid-2021: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-14/billboard.csv\nFor any songs that are in Spotify, the characteristicso of the song: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-09-14/audio-features.csv\n\nThe dada dictionary shows the characteristics from the Spotify songs, but it’s a little easier to understand if you take a look at Juan De Dios Santos’ post, asking: “Is my Spotify music boring? An analysis involving music, data, and machine learning”[https://towardsdatascience.com/is-my-spotify-music-boring-an-analysis-involving-music-data-and-machine-learning-47550ae931de]\n\nExamples\nAll of these examples were made with a the version of R and the tidyverse that was used in 2021, so you’ll see a few things in the code that are different, notably the use of %&gt;% instead of |&gt; as the pipe. They are either R scripts (.R extension) or R Markdown (.Rmd extension) , which is the predecessor to Quarto.\n\nTidyTuesday videos\nDavid Robinson, a data scientist at Heap, often creates live demos of his exploration of TidyTuesday datasets – data he’s never seen before. They’re long (usually about an hour), but you can watch him decide what to do and how to do it live. He made this video for the Hot 100 data. (The second half gets into machine learning / AI to make predictions – skip that part if you watch the video).\nHere are a few screen shots from that video – they’re closer to our exploratory visualization than the polished ones below;\n\n\nVisualizing characteristics\nThese are really polished, publication-quality vis examples made in R, but you can take inspiration from these to do draft versions for the purpose of exploration.\nLaurence Horton did a few quick charts to look at the Spotify characteristics.\nLaura Navarroshows us what [annotation can do for a chart]((https://github.com/lau-cloud/TidyTuesdaycode/blob/master/Billboard/script.R) . I’m super surprised at the relatively low showing of hip hop, but …\n\nDanielle Navarro wrote a full tutorial aimed at beginners in R , walking through the data to find and visualize all of Britney Spears’ hits. It has the added feature of explaining how to find her using regular expressions! (Yes, they’re both people named Navarro. I don’t know if they’re the same person.)\nAnd Javier Tamayo-Leiva went a little crazy with colors but found an interesting way to visualize the top hits using two dimensions: Number of weeks at No. 1 and the “energy” of the song. Here is the R code for that chart.\n\n\n\nhot100"

    "section": "25.2 Mapping FAQ",
    "text": "25.2 Mapping FAQ\n\nWhat is GIS?\nGraphical Information Systems are programs and apps built to work with data that have a spatial, or geographic, element to them. In them, data is meant to be worked with in maps or on a spatial plane or globe rather than in columns and rows. Examples of GIS systems are ESRI’s ArcMap, which is used primarily by researchers and government agencies who create the underlying maps we’ll use in journalism. They are relatively hard on a computer, and require more memory and disk space than we’ve used.\nA popular free and open source GIS system is QGIS, which will work on either Windows or Mac machines. There are excellent tutorials available for QGIS in journalism, including a Knight Center course (but the handout links are dead), and Alexandra Kanik’s prerequisite tutorials for a master class in mapping done for NICAR in 2022.\n\n\nWhat kinds of maps do we use?\n\n“Reference” maps are simply features on a screen or on paper. Think of Google Maps as reference maps. Cartographers take great care in making reference maps readable and useful, from the shape of each line or point to the color of kind of area like a mountain range. Font selection and line types are other elements that cartographers care about, so that it is possible to use the map for navigation or to picture a location.\n“Thematic maps” are the kind that we usually make in journalism: They are designed to illustrate data such as wealth, topography, or crime.\n\nGenerally, your project will begin by finding the right reference map for your work, then layer on top of it thematic elements from your data. Reference maps can come from many places, such as the Census TIGER program, Google Maps ($$$), OpenStreetMap, MapBox, Leaflet or other providers. You don’t have to make them yourself. Turn them into thematic maps by joining data to them or layering data on top.\n\n\nWhat are longitude and latitude?\nThese are the coordinates that define a spot on the globe. In GIS applications, you will usually get these as “decimal degrees” rather than the degree, minute, second form that you learned in junior high.\n\n\n\nSource: mapschool.io\n\n\nUsually, for local data, you will want the numbers to have at least three numbers after the decimal point. However, agencies often mask the actual locations in data they provide by lopping off decimals. Most coding services provide “rooftop” level positions, which have six numbers after the decimal point. For example, longitude (or X) -73.990593 and latitude (Y) 40.740121 define the position of the front of White House.\nIn the United States, longitude (X) is always negative (except Guam), because it’s in the Western Hemisphere. Latitude (Y) is always positive, because there is no place in the United States in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n\nWhat are features?\nEach layer on your map displays a “feature”, such as roads, schools, or Census tracts. At its simplest, a feature layer is one of the following three types:\n\n\n\nSource: mapschool.io\n\n\n\nPoints: The simplest of the types, a point is a place, defined by its longitude and latitude, or its XY position. You can get that information from the data you’re requesting or obtaining from the government, or you can try to figure it out yourself using a process called “geocoding”. We’ll come back to that.\nLines are strings of points smushed together — they don’t have to be straight, but they do not have the concept of an interior or exterior. You can find points along a line, or distances to a line. While there are many line features in reference maps, I have hardly ever used them in my work. People who work with traffic or water flows, however, use them a lot. You can use them to determine patterns on either side of a border, or a distance to a road.\nPolygons: These lines smushed together to form an enclosed area, such as a state, a Census tract or a Zip Code. They often touch one another, and you can always find out which points fall within each polygon using a “spatial join” – one of the most common tasks that we do. You can turn polygons into points by finding their center point, or centroid.\n\n\n\nRaster data and imagery : For simplification, each of the above types are considered “vector” data – they are defined by positions by connecting a whole bunch of points in space. But raster data, like satellite imagery, are just pixels of different colors. You can technically look at them in any program, but when they are imported to GIS systems, they become “georeferenced”, in that their edges are referenced to position on the globe. For now, we are not going to look at raster data.\n\n\n\n\nSource: mapschool.io\n\n\n“Attributes” are the data elements attached to features – columns in a database! Thematic maps use attributes such as income, population, or temperature to determine the size, color or shape of features on a maps.\n\n\nWhere do I get map data?\nUnlike other parts of the government, sharing map data is very common in agencies. They are so hard to make, and so useful, that most cities and states have GIS departments whose job it is to organize and document the map data.\nMap data comes in various forms – usually a bundle of files called “shapefiles”, which were originally created by ESRI. More modern systems often have “geojson” files, which are easier to use. Google Earth uses “KML” or “KMZ” data, which is also easy to use. JSON files are less efficient than shapefiles, so they are often much larger.\n\nLocal and state governments: In Arizona, the AZGEO hub (accessible with a free user account) coordinates the map data for many agencies of the state. At ASU, the library has a GIS lab with access to much of the base layer information needed, such as county voting districts. They also have contacts in local government who can help you find the underlying map data you need.\nFederal government: At the federal level, the US Geological Service can sometimes serve as a clearinghouse. The Weather Service, USDA and other agencies often have GIS data for free. The National Map also has many layers that can be used.\nThe Census Bureau has mapped every address and block in the US, and creates TIGER files for counties, voting districts, school districts and other political boundaries.\n\nFor very detailed maps, such as the footprints of property parcels in a county , you may have to buy the information. If you get it directly from the county, it shouldn’t be a lot – maybe $100 – but if you buy it privately, it can cost thousands of dollars.\n\nGetting map data from ESRI / ArcMap\nMany government agencies have turned their GIS applications over to the private company, ESRI, and make them public through that system. It’s often quite confusing to download data from ESRI, but it is often possible. If you don’t see a way to use the data yourself, then call the agency responsible for it and ask – you will usually be able to get them to send it to you or give you instructions on where to find it. We’ll look at an example of getting data from an ESRI map in the next chapter.\n\n\n\nWhat if my data doesn’t have longitude and latitude?\nThe process of turning addresses into points on a map is called “geocoding”, and it is one of the most expensive and time-consuming processes in data journalism. The reason is that there are so many ways to represent an address, and that addresses change all the time. It’s not unusual to have 95 percent of your addresses map perfectly, but then you have to look at the remaining 5 percent to see whether there are consistent errors. When I used to do a lot of mapping in Washington, DC, there were three types of addresses that routinely failed – anything on North or South Capitol Street; anything on Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue, and anything on Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue. That meant that any map I made, if I didn’t deal with these problems, would be misleading because they would be missing those locations. Geocoding New York City addresses in Queens can also be difficult.\nWe’re not the only ones who struggle with geocoding. In Los Angeles, reporters once found that the crime data supplied to the public was wrong – every time its geocoding failed, it put the crime at 1st and Spring Streets, which was the center of the city map. (Data used inside the police department was correct, because it came from a different source – the GPS data sent by police when they made a stop.)\nThis means that whenever you ask the government for data, you should ALWAYS ask for geographic coordinates and ask if they have GIS files (often using shapefiles). They may not give them to you, but it will save days of work and be much more accurate than trying to put them on a map yourself."

    "text": "25.3 A note on projections\n\nProjections are what we call the mathematical equations that do the trick of turning the world into some flat shape that fits on a printout or a computer screen. It’s a messy task to do, this transformation - there’s no way to smoosh the world onto a screen without distorting it in some way. You either lose direction, or relative size, or come out with something very weird looking.\n-- mapschool.io\n\nThis clip from The West Wing shows how projections can change the way you see the world.\n\nYou can play around with how the standard map distorts size at https://thetruesize.com\nBecause every map has a defined projection, you can’t do anything with one without the maker of the map telling you how it’s been flattened.\n\nGeographic coordinate systems\nGeorgraphic coordinate systems are often used for point features, because they describe posiitons on a globe. They are also often used for reference, or base, maps because they’re easy to use and transform.\nWGS84 with the code ESPG:4326, for World Geodetic System (1984 version) is the standard coordinate system for international data and GPS systems.\nNAD83 or EPSG:4269, is the standard used by the Census Bureau for North American data.\n\n\nProjected coordinate systems\nWhere geographic coordinate systems are measured in degrees, projected coordinate systems use units of measure that we understand – usually feet or meters. They are used more frequently to define direction, distance or shape. Where you would need a lot of geometry to compute the distance between two points on a globe, the distance between two points in a projected system are just the Pythagorean theorem you used in 6th grade: x2 + y2 = distance2\nIf a map is projected, it will usually have the information built into the data file. This is one of the files that makes up the bundle for shapefiles, and the other types have the projection built in. R and other mapping systems will usually recognize it.\nHowever, state and local agencies often leave this part out. In those cases, look for a standard projection used by the state. For Maricopa County, the standard is North American Datum 1983, Arizona State Plane, Central Zone, HARN, in feet (code 2868). For US data, many people use the U.S. national atlas equal area projection, or crs 9311 (especially if you’re only showing the lower 48) or ESRI:102009.\nThere’s a lot of complicated math that goes into flattening the earth into two dimensions for viewing on a screen or a piece of paper. Each of these projections has a number of characteristics, so instead of listing all of them whenever you want to use them, they have codes. You can look up codes using https://spatialreference.org/.\nNow that you have some working knowledge of GIS, we can move onto making maps."

Neither is better - tmap is a little easier and requires a little less typing, but is not quite as easy to marry with other Javascript interactive maps or to customize using ggplot."

    "section": "27.1 The PDF problem",
    "text": "27.1 The PDF problem\nMany government agencies distribute data in PDF, or Adobe Portable Document Format. As the full name implies, these are documents, not data. It is geared at getting text and images properly placed on a page, not creating tidy data as we have been dealing with in previous chapters.\nSome software – Excel, Google Sheets, Microsoft Access and others – create PDF’s as one of their output formats. In fact, there is an entire ecosystem of pdf report makers, such as Crystal Reports. But converting them back into a usable dataset is often a challenge because we want columns and rows, not positions of words on a page.\nSome people call the process of returning a PDF to a data format as “scraping”. Others call it “report mining”. People with a lot of money can use automation tools, notable Altria’s Monarch product, to do this at scale with few errors, but it costs at least $2,000 / year / person for software like this, so few reporters have access.\n\nUnderstanding your pdf\nPDF’s come in two very different types. The first is the more common version: reports generated from other software, such as Quarto, that contain text similar to a formatted Google or Word doc. The other is an image file, which is what is produced by scanning old documents, or sometimes from public records requests in which the agency has printed out a document, redacted it, and scanned it back into an electronic form for distribution.\nIf there are a lot of hand-written annotations on the page, then it is most likely an image. Another test is to try selecting the text on the screen. If you can’t do it (your cursor turns into an image selection tool, or it just selects the whole page), you are really only dealing with pixels and, to the computer, it is nothing different than a picture of your dog. If the selection covers the text and skips around, then it has underlying text and it can be used with most pdf parsing programs.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) selecting text in a pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) selecting image in a pdf\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27.1: PDF types\n\n\nWhen you have an image, you will need a first step, or more expensive software, to deal with it. Most reporters use Google Pinpoint or DocumentCloud to do the “optical character recognition”, or OCR, necessary to work with them. A full version of Adobe Acrobat (not the reader) will also work. Some of the more expensive products listed below have versions that include OCR. But just know that if you have an image, your ability to parse these could be very difficult.\n\n\nDeveloping a strategy\nEvery PDF project is different. There are a few strategies you can employ to make it a little more replicable, but it’s always a difficult problem that doesn’t translate well from project to project.\nIf you are going to spend money on a tool for anything in data journalism, this is probably the place to spend it.\nHere are some things to think about:\n\nTry every simple tool and see if anything works. Each of the tools that turn PDFs into data work in a slightly different way, and each one makes different kinds of mistakes. It’s very easy to run a test set of documents through each product and see if any works almost perfectly.\nConsider re-typing! If you have a pdf created from a spreadsheet, you will likely spend less time retyping 100 or so rows if the simple tools don’t work.\nYou may have to use a combination of the tool and a program to get the data you want. If that is the case, try to find a conversion that preserves the position on the page, which is the one thing that’s accurate in the PDF. In that case, you write programs or spreadsheet formulas to look for a pattern like a date in certain columns that can then be used to identify different kinds of lines.\nConsider whether you really need the PDF in data form at all. If, for example, your goal is to see if the same names show up in different documents, Pinpoint or DocumentCloud might do just as well using a different process called entity extraction.\n\n\n\nExample document\nThe document we’ll use for testing is the most recent lobbying report from the city of Phoenix. This is a bare-bones report of 14 pages, which has repeated sections of the names of individual lobbyists underneath the name of the lobbying company and the date filed:\n\n\n\nWork from the goal backwards\nThe goal would be to have one dataset with the following columns:\n\nDate of filing\nName of lobbying organization\nLobbyist name 2\n\nThe filing and organization data would be repeated for each of the lobbyists.\nThis seems so simple! In your head, you can see exactly how that would work. But now you have to spend some time thinking about how you’ll get there.\nOne trick in reversing PDFs is to look for anything with a pattern that distinguishes one KIND of row from another – a heading, an indentation, etc. In this case, it’s the line with the date at the end that will make the biggest difference.\nIn this case, we have to find a way to apply the name of the organization and its most recently updated date to all of the rows of the lobbyist names. The pattern is that there is no date on the lobbyist list, but there is always a date on the organization row. (Sometimes indentations and formatting can help, but not always.)"

Here are some of the common ones used in newsrooms.\n\nTabula\nTabula.technology is a downloadable program that, once unzipped into your applications or document folder, runs in a browser. The most recent version is more than 5 years old, though, so it isn’t being actively updated or refined. Because it’s a Java-based program, it may not be possible to easily use it on all computers. I’m not sure it’s worth fiddling with if it doesn’t work on yours.\nHere’s a quick video of how Tabula works on this document:\n(I cut at least 5 minutes of waiting out of this video!)\n\n\n\nCometdocs\nUsually, Cometdocs is one of the most reliable conversions. But even after setting up an account, this is what I got:\nAt times, Investigative Reporters and Editors has arranged for free professional accounts. Check if they still have the program if you’re a member.\n\n\n\nzamzar\nZamzar did quite well with this, producing a file that can be used because it kept the concept of two columns and didn’t smush rows together.\n\n\n\nAdobe Acrobat ($)\nEvery ASU student has an automatic account for the full version of Adobe Acrobat. The online version has limited capabilities, but it also allows you to download the full version. But in this instance, it failed miserably:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noutput\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27.2: Using Acrobat\n\n\nIt tried to replicate the way the data looks in the page, which smushed together the individual lobbyists even though they’re clearly on separate lines.\n\n\nAble2Extract ($)\nAble2Extract from Invetintech.com is an all-purpose PDF extractor and producer, with the professional version costing $200. It’s got a lot of options for tricky tables, and it also does OCR if necessary before trying to extract any information. (Only Acrobat on the above list does that as well.) It’s the one I use most frequently. In this case, it did nothing different than the free versions, but it also permits you to keep the position on the page instead of converting to an Excel or CSV file, making it easier if you want to manually parse the lines.\n\n\nGoogle Pinpoint’s Table Extractor\nGoogle Pinpoint is a service available only to journalists. You have to apply for an account and, for the time being, apply for the beta add-on.\nHaving Google Pinpoint is a great option if all you want to know is whether the same entity shows up across documents. It also provides free audio and video transcription, and free OCR of image documents. It’s similar to DocumentCloud, but is geared less at publishing documents and more at managing the collection of material vacuumed up in an investigation.\nFor now, it doesn’t work very well on our sample document. It’s just not the right form for it. It works best on collections of individual forms with headings , where one PDF is one form. An example of a good document for Pinpoint is a collection of “Suspected Illegal Alien Form” documents from AZDPS, where each box has a label and it’s not a table:"

If you need to move your project to another computer, you can use the Export options once it’s open.\n\n\nRename or copy columns\nEventually, you’ll want to re-import the results of your cleaning to your R or other programming environment, and it will cause you no end of trouble if you can’t match it up with the original data, or if columns have the same names.\n\nBefore you do any work on a column, be sure to either rename it or copy it into a new column. Someday you’ll thank me for this.\n\nTo rename something that is relatively simple to clean, such as the project_county in the PPP data, use the dropdown menu, and choose Edit column-&gt;Rename this column . I usually call it whatever the column name started as with a suffix _refined.\n\nRename the columns project_county and project_state now.\n\nTo make a copy, use the dropdown menu Edit column-&gt;Add column based on this column and give it a name."

    "text": "28.5 Clustering\nOne reason a lot of reporters use OpenRefine is to take advantage of its fuzzy-matching to clean items like names and addresses. It provides about a dozen different algorithms that provide suggestions on ways to change unstandardized values in a column that often make a lot of sense.\nThis walkthrough will work on the city name.\n\nMake a copy of the city and call it borrower_city_refined by using the dropdown Edit column-&gt;Add column based on this column . Otherwise you risk over-writing things incorrectly, and you’ll have to try to figure out where you went wrong.\n\n\n\n\nadd column\n\n\n\nNow create a facet on this new column.\n\nYou should see all of the bad values that were entered into that column by lenders and applicants. No one cared whether it was a valid city name.\n\nClustering details\nYou’ll often use many of the clustering approaches, then finish up with some other filters and facets when the clustering doesn’t work.\nSome algorithms work better than others – some don’t catch natural clusters, and others find a lot of things to cluster that shouldn’t be combined. It’s unimportant for us what they actually do behind the scenes. Insetad, just know that they are different methods to find near-exact matches among character values.\nOne might look for all words that have the same letters but in any order, another might look for everything that matches the shortest phrase, and another might look for any 2 words in common. The order suggested by OpenRefine generally goes from the most strict to the most forgiving method, and from the easiest on your computer to the most resource-intensive. 2\n\nOn the facet, press the button that says “Cluster”. The first one chosen, called “key collision” by “fingerprint”, doesn’t come up with any suggestions.\nUse the dropdown menu in the Keying Function box to choose the next option, “ngram-fingerprint”, and leave the option at 2.\n\n\n\n\ncluster\n\n\nNow you can see how close some of the choices are.\n\nLook through your choices, and select any that you want to combine. OpenRefine will change the least popular entry to the most popular, but you can change what you want it to be in the box provided. (At first, you’ll probably “Select all” and then just un-select the bad ones.)\nKeep going with other clustering methods, turning off the ones you’re not sure should be combined and editing the value you want it to be. After exploring all of the options, I often end by going back to the ngram-fingerprint method and changing it to Ngram size of 1. That often catches the last remnants of one-word cities.\n\n\n\n\nngram\n\n\n\nSpend about 10-15 minutes cleaning up the cities, and see how close you can get to a good list.\n\n\nPro tip: Don’t try to do everything through clustering. You can’t really fine-tune the choices, so just stop when it’s getting close. You can then do the remaining things you care about manually. Try not to get too obsessed with getting it perfect. You’ll spend days on things that won’t matter, especially in early stages of your reporting when you don’t know what you care about.\n\n\n\nFacet for long entries\nIn this list, though, there are addresses that are listed as cities. We may just want to remove those city names entirely, since we don’t really know what they are. There are several ways you might do this:\n\nUse the Facet-&gt;Customized facets-&gt;Text length facet menu item to create a facet by string length. Use the scrollbar to choose, say, more than 20 or 25 characters.\nGo through the list and select the ones that should not be changed, then\nInvert the selection and use the Transform menu to change the city to “Unknown”.\n\nThat got rid of most of them. You can go back to the original facet and select the ones at the top and change them as well.\nThe list isn’t perfect, but it’s much better than what we started with."

Generally, I use regular expressions in this box so I can control where in the column my target word or letters falls.\nTry filtering for ^Phoe after checking the “regular expression” box, and you’ll see a few stray entries for Phoenix that you can change in the facet window.\n\nI tend to do this for anything I really care about getting right, such as larger cities or towns that I am going to report on. It’s often not worth the time to get a large list 100% accurate.\n\n\nComplex filter\nA complex filter will help you tag items for later use. One example is to tag items that contain apartment numbers, suite numbers or floor numbers after the address. Eventually, we may want to split the address column in two – one piece for the street address, and one piece for the detailed location.\nFiltering for them first ensures that you won’t inadvertently split something that hasn’t met your condition in the first place.\nRegular expressions work here the same way they did in str_detect in R, except that there is one backslash rather than two for special characters.\n\nHere is an example of how to find anything that has the word Suite or Ste after at least 10 other characters: .{10,}\\bS(ui)?te\\b\n\n\n\n\nexample regex\n\n\nUsing these filters, we can start splitting the values into their pieces.\n\n\nSplit by regex\n\nChoose Edit column-&gt;Split into several columns… from the dropdown menu, then use the regular expression as the “split” character. Make sure to un-check the “Guess cell type” and “Remove this column” boxes.\n\nYou can go back and look for entries that have “floor” or “apt” the same way, and split them in subsequent steps.\n\n\nSplit using OpenRefine programming language\nThat took care of the ones that had Suite numbers in them. Now we have to get the ones that have Apartment numbers in them. Use a regular expression to filter for the apartment numbers, and a Customized Facet-&gt;Facet by null to pick out the ones that haven’t already been split by our previous step.\nOpenRefine has its own special language called GREL, which is really hard to use. But we’ll have to use it for this set because we’ve already split something else. This time, we have to put a value in the two columns based on pieces of a regular expression.\n\nWith your filter on, choose borrower_address_refined_2’s Transform menu. I’ll just show you how to do this, since it’s hard to explain:\n\n-In the “Expression” box, copy and paste this code:\ncells[\"borrower_address_refined\"].value.match(/(.+)?\\b(Apt .*)\\b$/)[1]\nThis tells OpenRefine to extract two pieces from the original address column: The beginning (.+)?, the word “Apt” followed by anything at the end. The [1] tells OpenRefine to take the 2nd of those (its counting starts at zero, not one) and put it in the same column that we used for the Suite numbers. (NOTE: The GREL regular expressions are indicated by the two slashes at the beginning and end of the phrase (/). This is typical for regular expressions, and it distinguishes them from plain text.)\n\nRepeat the process, in the borrower_address_refined_1 column’s transformation, and use the index [0] at the end to get the cleaned street address."

But we often also get data from publicly published sources, usually on the web.\nThere are three ways to get data from the web:\n\nDownload it, or use an API1. In these cases, the makers of the data have specifically offered it up for your use in a useful format. We’ll cover API’s later, but don’t forget to study the site for a download link or option. If there isn’t one on a government site, you might call the agency and ask that they add one. They might just do it. We’ve been using downloadable data throughout this book.\nFind it on your browser. Often the person making the website delivers structured data to your browser as a convenience. It’s easier for them to make interactive items on their page by using data they’ve already delivered in visualizations and tables. It also reduces the loads on their servers. These are usually in JSON format. You might be able to find it right on your computer. It’s a miracle!\nScrape it. This set of chapters goes over how to scrape content that is delivered in HTML form – a web page. There would be other methods to scrape PDFs, which can be easy or hard."

Use the Chrome browser for this - Firefox and Safari also have similar features, but they look different.\nHere is a simple page that will show you what the json looks like and how to extract it. This is what a human sees:\n\nThe table of presidents is actually produced using a small javascript program inside the HTML that walks through each item and lists it as a row.\n\nOpen the page in Chrome, then right-click anywhere on the page and choose “Inspect”. It may appear as just two items - the “head” and the “body”. But notice the little arrows - they show you that there is more content underneath. For now, we’ll ignore this, but it will be important later.\nChoose the Network tab, then re-load the page.\n\n\n\n\ninspect network\n\n\nThis shows you everything that the browser is attempting to load into your browser. (You may not see the “favicon” item. I have no idea why it’s showing up on mine - it’s not been requested!)\nYou can ignore most of this. Importantly, the “simple-page.html” is the actual page, and the “simple.json” is the data! Click on the simple.json row, then choose the “Response” tab:\n\n\n\nsimple json\n\n\nThat’s what json looks like - a list of rows within an item called “presidents”, each identified by the name of the column they’ll become.2\n\nRight-click on the simple.json file name, and you’ll see a lot of options. Choose the one that says Copy-&gt;Copy link address.\nGo to a new browser window and search for “json to csv”. This one is one that I often see first.\nPaste your copied link in the tab that says, “Enter URL” and press “Load URL”. You’ll see an option to copy the result as a csv file!\n\n\n\n\njson to csv\n\n\n\nA harder example\nThat was easy! But it’s also trivial. However, this method can often save you from having to page through results of a page. One example is the Maricopa County nightly list of mugshots, which may have several hundred new entries each day. Here’s what today’s looked like on a desktop browser (it looks different on a smaller screen).3:\n\n\n\nmcso list\n\n\nIt looks like you’d have to go through each of the five pages to get all of the names of people who were booked into jail that night, but often a json file contains all of them – they’re just showing you one page at a time.\n\nThis page won’t let you right-click to get the inspector. Instead, on a Mac, press Opt-Cmd-C to open the inspector window. (I think it’s Shft-Ctl-C on Windows, but I’m not sure.)\n\nThis looks like a mess! Don’t worry. Switch to the Network tab, and re-load the page. This time, there are dozens of different things that get loaded on your page, and none of them are obviously json. You have a few strategies to find it.\n\nPress the “Fetch/XHR” tab to see if it shows up there. Use the “Preview” tab to look at what each of them is, and, miracle of miracles, it’s the third one on the list! Even better, it has all 425 entries! (It looks like they’re split into groups of 100, but they really aren’t.)\n\n\n\n\nmiracle 1\n\n\n\nRight-click on the name of the file, and choose Copy-&gt;Copy link, and repeat the process above to convert it to a CSV file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn 2022, the county began limiting the number of results to some random list of 300. It appears that searching for an inmate only checks those first 300 results. (It could have been a coincidence that there were exactly 300 inmate on Jan 3, 2023, but I doubt it.)\n\n\n\n\nAn even harder example\nThe New York Times maintains a map with the vaccination rates for various demographic groups by county on its website. At first, the Times didn’t provide a Github repo for the data. How can we extract the data from this map?\nThe easiest way would be to see if it contains a json miracle!\n\nOpen your inspector panel\nCopy and paste the link to the map page, and open it in your Chrome browser with the inpsectors showing.\nSwitch to the network tab. (If you opened the map before opening the inspector, reload it now. )\n\nYikes! The “Fetch /XHR” button doesn’t help us much here. There are too many different json files to check. We could look one by one and see if they’re right, but sometimes that’s just too hard. Instead,\n\nOpen the “Search” button on your inspector (it’s different from the Filter), and type in a county name (this one is “Maricopa”). You should see only a few of them. The most promising is the “doses_county.json”, so try that one first:\n\n\n\n\nnyt example\n\n\nThis time, it’s hard to find the item in the list of files in the browser. Instead, right-click in the “Preview” area, and copy the object. You can paste that into the box in the JSON to csv converter instead of entering a URL."

    "text": "29.3 No json? No problem (maybe)\nYou may not be able to find a json file – either it’s too hard to find, or it’s not useful, or it doesn’t exist. For a simple page, there’s no problem getting the data in Google Sheets. (This is one area where Excel lags behind Google Sheets.) We’ll go into HTML tags in more depth in the next chapter, but if your data is held in a table or structured list, you can import it directly into Google sheets.\nNote that this trick is really only useful if your page doesn’t change a lot, or if you just want a one-time snapshot. It doesn’t automatically update, and I don’t know how to capture changes – it would involve a Google scripting program, which I don’t know how to do. I’ve never learned because I usually only gather data for my own use, and it’s easier to program it than to finagle Google Sheets.\nThe trick to using Google Sheets is to find a table tag (&lt;table&gt;) or a list tag (&lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt;) that contains the data you want.\nHere’s an example, taken from a previous year’s MAIJ cohort: Reporters wanted to know whether Scottsdale was relatively unique in its city council structure, which has no districts. All members are at-large. Some research suggests that this disempowers non-white or less wealthy areas, because more privileged residents are often more active in local politics.\nThe reporters knew it was rare, but one question nagged at them: Was Scottsdale the largest city in the nation with a purely at-large council? That would make a nice tidbit for the story, but it wasn’t worth a major data collection endeavor.\nBallotpedia, a crowdsourced website with information on local governments, had collected a page of city council officials in the 100 largest cities in the US. Extracting this information into a structured table, then using regular expressions, could help make that a relatively simple job. This could even be done in Google Sheets, which also has a regular expression implementation. Because it’s so rare, just getting a list of cities that had no district or ward membership would give them a place to start looking up populations.\nThis information is stored in an HTML table, identified by the “\n\n” element.\nRight-click on the page, and open your inspector. It looks like a mess, but you can search for tables using a simple “Find” using Cmd (or Ctl) -F.\nYou may notice it says you can find by string, selector or XPath.\nIn the box, enter “&lt;table” (with the opening “&lt;”, but no closing one.). You should see “1 of 12” in the result box. As you go through the list, the currently selected table will be highlighted. When you hit “3 of 12”, you’ll notice that the browser has selected the table you want. That’s the information we need.\nOpen a Google Sheet, and copy the page URL to cell A1. This just makes it easier to construct the formula to extract the table.\nIn cell A3, enter the following formula:\n      \n      =ImportHTML(A1, \"table\", 3)That means, “Go to the web address listed in cell A1, look for”table” tags, then return whatever is in the third one.”\n\n\ngooglesheet\n\nWhen you hit “enter” the whole table will populate on your Google Sheet. Unfortunately, you can’t get the link to the city from this method, which means you don’t have a good way to extract a city name. We’ll come back to this when we go to scraping in R. (There is a way to get this in Google Sheets, but it’s not very reliable – it will choke as soon as it encounters a missing URL.)But if you just need the text of a table or list in a spreadsheet, this is an easy way to get it. (To get a list from an “ol” or “ul” (ordered and unordered lists) tag, use “list” instead of “table”.)\n29.4 Recap\nSometimes – especially on modern websites that create interactive elements on the fly – the data you need is already sitting on your computer. In fact, it’s quite hard to scrape those in other ways because the HTML is created when it’s loaded into your browser.\nBut when it’s not, there may be another simple way to get the content.\nThe problem is that getting the content without programming can leave you unsatisfied because you can only get the text, not any of the underlying information. The next chapter shows you one method of getting more information from a web page using CSS selectors.\nI sometimes use a Chrome extension called “Chrome Scraper” to get slightly more complex information out of a website, which uses a language called XPath to parse a web page.

    "text": "30.1 Understanding a web page and its structure\nWeb pages are written in HTML, even if they don’t have “html” at the end of the file name.\nHTML is like an upside-down tree. It has a trunk, which is an &lt;html&gt; tag, then two main branches: &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;. The content of the page branches out from the body tag:\n\n\n\nDatacamp html tree\n\n\nAll of HTML is just text. The tags tell your browser how to render each element, while attributes give them extra information, like the URL of a link, or a formatting class.\nWe can navigate the tree using RVest.\n\n\nOpen or create a project in RStudio, and create a new document. You can do this as a new markdown document, or as an R Script.\nThe code to load two libraries:\n\n\n#| label: setup-scrape2\n#| message: false \n#| warning: false\n#| echo: true\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest) \n\n\nAnd run your setup chunk.\n\n\nThe library rvest splits up the tree into its distinct elements, retaining the structure of the tree. The read_html() function takes a chunk of text, a page saved on your computer, or a page on the internet and parses it into its pieces.\nWe’re going to parse the page using “css selectors”, which tells the program how to navigate the page. The css selector can use the tag , an attribute, or both to find elements on the page. In this case, there is only one table, so we can just find one element using the “table” tag.\nThis method of scraping doesn’t work if the page was created on the fly by executing a Javascript program on your browser, the way that the simple page in the last chapter did. Those pages usually have a json dataset that you can grab more easily.\nHere’s what the page looks like when rendered, with the full tree shown on the right.\n\n\n\nfull page\n\n\nThis code parses the simple page at the address shown into its pieces, and save the result as my_htmlYou may notice that I’ve broken up the code to do one thing at a time. First, it saves the address in a variable called “url”. Then it uses the same piping we used in data work.1\n\n# label: readpres\n# echo: true\n# eval: false\n\nurl &lt;- \"https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/presidents.html\"\n\nmy_html &lt;-\n  url |&gt;  \n  read_html()\n\n\nprint(my_html)\n\n{html_document}\n&lt;html&gt;\n[1] &lt;head&gt;\\n&lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8 ...\n[2] &lt;body&gt;\\n   &lt;h1&gt;A heading&lt;/h1&gt;\\n   &lt;p class=\"intro\"&gt; This is  a paragraph  ...\n\n\nThis is a complex object, and you’re only seeing the beginning of it – the two elements that are at the top of the tree. You’ll notice that there is a new object that is a data type called a list rather than a data frame in you environment. Lists are used to store complicated structures that don’t fit neatly into rectangle.\nTo find any element, like the table, use its tag in an html_node() . To find all of the elements of a type, make it plural, like html_nodes().2\nUse the tag name or CSS selector to get just a piece of the page.\n\nmy_html |&gt;\n html_element(\"body\") \n\n{html_node}\n&lt;body&gt;\n[1] &lt;h1&gt;A heading&lt;/h1&gt;\n[2] &lt;p class=\"intro\"&gt; This is  a paragraph with italic&lt;/p&gt;\n[3] &lt;div&gt;\\n     &lt;p&gt; This is a simple table&lt;/p&gt;\\n     &lt;table&gt;\\n&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;t ...\n\n\nTo get all of the paragraphs, make the command plural. Note how you now get the HTML of the selected elements in their entirety.\n\nmy_html |&gt;\n  html_elements (\"p\")\n\n{xml_nodeset (2)}\n[1] &lt;p class=\"intro\"&gt; This is  a paragraph with italic&lt;/p&gt;\n[2] &lt;p&gt; This is a simple table&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\nAnd to get everything with a class of “intro”, use a period to indicate a class, and convert it to text using the html_text function, asking R to remove extra whitespace with the “trim” argument.\n\nmy_html |&gt;\n  html_elements (\".intro\") |&gt;\n  html_text (trim=T)\n\n[1] \"This is  a paragraph with italic\"\n\n\n\nA special type: table\nTables are so commonly scraped that rvest has special way to extract the values, just as we did in Google Sheets, which puts it right into a data frame:\n\nmy_html |&gt;\n  html_element (\"table\")  |&gt;\n  html_table ()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe singular version of html_element() picks out the first piece that matches the selector. The plural version would result in a list of all of them, from which you can select the number you want using the odd syntax .[[n]], where “n” is the table number.\n\n\nA harder example: Ballotpedia\nHere’s an example using the ballotpedia page we used in the last section:\n\nurl &lt;-\"https://ballotpedia.org/List_of_current_city_council_officials_of_the_top_100_cities_in_the_United_States\"\n\nballotpedia &lt;- \n  url |&gt;\n  read_html() |&gt;\n  html_elements(\"table\")\n\nprint (ballotpedia)\n\n{xml_nodeset (12)}\n [1] &lt;table class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align: center; width:200px\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\\n ...\n [2] &lt;table class=\"bptable sortable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"background: ...\n [3] &lt;table class=\"bptable gray sortable\" id=\"officeholder-table\" style=\"widt ...\n [4] &lt;table class=\"wikitable;\" style=\"width=100%\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;th colspan= ...\n [5] &lt;table class=\"navbox\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\";\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"pa ...\n [6] &lt;table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible autocollapse\" styl ...\n [7] &lt;table class=\"navbox\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\";\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"pa ...\n [8] &lt;table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible autocollapse\" styl ...\n [9] &lt;table class=\"navbox\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\";\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"pa ...\n[10] &lt;table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible autocollapse\" styl ...\n[11] &lt;table class=\"navbox\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\";\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"pa ...\n[12] &lt;table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible autocollapse\" styl ...\n\n\nLooking at this, we have several ways to get at the proper table. We can pick the third element that we just got:\n\nballotpedia[[3]]\n\n{html_node}\n&lt;table class=\"bptable gray sortable\" id=\"officeholder-table\" style=\"width:auto; border-bottom:1px solid #bcbcbc;\"&gt;\n[1] &lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#4c4c4c!important;color:#fff!imp ...\n[2] &lt;tbody&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td style=\"padding-left:10px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://ballotpedi ...\n\n\nor, you might notice that it has an “id” attribute called ‘officeholder-table’.\n\noffice_holders &lt;-\n  url |&gt;\n  read_html() |&gt;\n  html_node(\"#officeholder-table &gt; tbody\")\n\nIf you print it, you’ll see something like this:\n\n\n\noffice image\n\n\n\n\nGetting the link\nBefore, in Google Sheets, we had no way to pick up the list of links that would tell us what city each member was in. That’s also true when we use the html_table() function to turn it into a data frame:\n\noffice_table &lt;- \n  url |&gt;\n  read_html() |&gt;\n  html_node(\"#officeholder-table\") |&gt;  # keep the whole table to get headings \n  html_table()\n\nBut now we can get a list of the names of cities by extracting an “attribute” from the tag. (This is a little harder than I’d intended because not every row has a link, meaning we have to rejigger the formula to create empty rows when the link doesn’t exist.)\n\ncity_links &lt;-\n  ballotpedia[[3]] |&gt;  # the third table in our list\n  html_nodes (\"tbody &gt; tr\") |&gt;  # all rows\n  html_node (\"td &gt; a\") |&gt;  # justlink tag in the first column \n  html_attr(\"href\")  # the URL\n  \n\ntail(city_links)\n\n[1] \"https://ballotpedia.org/Barbara_Hanes_Burke\"         \n[2] \"https://ballotpedia.org/Jeff_MacIntosh\"              \n[3] \"https://ballotpedia.org/John_Larson_(North_Carolina)\"\n[4] \"https://ballotpedia.org/James_Taylor,_Jr.\"           \n[5] \"https://ballotpedia.org/Kevin_Mundy\"                 \n[6] \"https://ballotpedia.org/Robert_C._Clark\"             \n\n\nWe’ve never done this before, but we can add this list as a column to the data frame using the tidyverse add_column() function of the tidyverse . At the same time, you can put your regular expression muscles to work by “extracting” rather than “detecting” a pattern3:\n\noffice_table |&gt;\n  add_column (city=city_links, .before=\"Office\") |&gt;\n  mutate (city_extracted = str_extract(city, \"ballotpedia.org\\\\/(.*)$\", group=1) , .after=\"city\") |&gt;\n  sample_n(20)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(The str_extract () function matches everything after the last slash , because we put parentheses around the last part, which is a a capture group. This capability used to be very difficut in R – now it’s a bit easier. )\nIt doesn’t work perfectly, but it generally gets us a bit closer to a city name."

This is what a “p” open and close tag looks like, with the text inside it shown on the page:\n&lt;p&gt; This is a paragraph &lt;/p&gt;\n\nHere is a list of common tags you’ll use in scraping:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntag\ndescription\n\n\n\n\np\nor a paragraph\n\n\ndiv\na block of text , or division of the page.\n\n\nspan\nAn area within a div or p element that is treated specially without it breaking into a new line.\n\n\na\na link. It should always have an attribute of href, which is the URL to the link.\n\n\nh1 through h6\nwhich are headline levels. “h1” is the headline, “h2” is a sub-head, and so on.\n\n\n\nModern websites might have these sections, which are used instead of the “div” tag:\n\n\n\ntag\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nnav\na navigational menu\n\n\nmain\nthe main block of the page with the content\n\n\naside\na sidebar\n\n\nfooter\nthe stuff at the bottom.\n\n\n\nTables are structured like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntag\ndescription\n\n\n\n\ntable\nthe main container.\n\n\nthead and tbody\nA heading area and the body area.

These are subsequent rows within tbody\n\n\ntd\nall of the cells (columns). These are always WITHIN a tr or th element.\n\n\n\nAny of these can be nested within any others. Typically, a page starts with an “h1” tag, then has “div” tags for different sections, such as the sidebar or the main content. An “a” tag is typically nested within others.\nStandalone tags:\nA few tags don’t have opening and closing versions - they just stand alone:\nimg - an image to show. It would have a src attribute for the link, and an alt attribute for text to show for accessibility. example: &lt;img src=\"path-to-my-image\" alt=\"This is a picture of...\"&gt;\nbr - A hard line break.\n\n\nCommon attributes for tags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntag\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nhref\nthe URL of a link within an a tag.\n\n\nsrc\nthe path to an image, within an img tag.\n\n\nclass\na reference to a CSS class. More than one class can be identified, separated with a space.\n\n\nid\na unique name for this element using CSS\n\n\n\nPeople can also make up their own attributes - they’re arbitrary.\n\n\nRvest functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunction\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nread_html()\nto parse the page.

    "section": "A.1 The PERS: Fractions, rates, percents and per capita",
    "text": "A.1 The PERS: Fractions, rates, percents and per capita\nYou can usually simplify your story if you can re-jigger your numbers into a rate, a ratio or a percentage. “One out of four” is a fraction, or a rate. “Forty percent” is another ratio or rate. And 235 deaths per 100,000 people is another.\nPercents and fractions are used to scale of very large or very small numbers while putting them into perspective.\nRates are also used to level the playing field – they compare two items that have a different base.\nWhen you see a lot of numbers in copy, examine them to see if a simple rate – “one of four” or 25 percent – would simplify your story.\n\nFractions and percents\nRepeat this: “Percents are fractions. Fractions are percents.” Remembering this all the time will keep you focused on the key element of percentages: They’re ratios, or rates, expressed as a fraction of 100.\n\nFiguring a percent:\nStep 1: Know your base. Think of the words “out of.” It’s the total of all the groups.\nStep 2: Divide the category you care about by the base.\nRemember that a fraction sign (/) means “divided by” (÷).\nStep 3: Move the decimal point two places to the right (or multiply by 100) to get the rate per hundred, or percent.\nStep 4: Round the answer to no more than one decimal place. Better\nyet, look for an easier fraction your readers will understand.\n\nFormula\nStep 1: Total = The base\nStep 2: (Category / Total) = Proportion\nStep 3: Proportion x 100 = Percent\nStep 4: Round and simplify.\n\nExample\nIf 58 people say they will vote in an upcoming election and 92 say they won’t, this is how to compute the percent of people who claim they will vote:\nStep 1: Base = number of people asked = 92 + 58 = 150\nStep 2: Rate = 58 out of 150 = 58/150 = .386666..\nStep 3: Percent = .38666… x 100 = 38.666666….\nStep 4: Round and simplify: = nearly 40 percent\n\n\n\nFrom fractions to percents and back\n\n\n\nYou probably know that 1 out of 4 is one-quarter, and that it’s also 25 percent. But you may not know how to get from one to another.\nFrom fractions to percents:\n1/4 = 1 ÷ 4 = 0.25. Move the decimal place over two places, or multiply by 100, to get 25%\nFrom percents to fractions:\n\nWrite your percent as a fraction: 25/100\nTry to find a “least common denominator:” 25 in this case goes into both the top and the bottom. You might want to round off either number to come out to a simple denominator.\nSimplify: (25 / 25) / (100 / 25) = 1 / 4\n\nTo get “One out of “ numbers:\n\nExpress your percentage as a proportion by dividing by 100, so 25% is 0.25.\nNow divide one by that number: 1 / .25 = 4, so your answer is one-fourth.\n\nTip for spreadsheet users: Excel allows you to format a number as a fraction or a percent. Play around with formats to see how the number is most easily described.\n\n\n\n\n\nRates and per capita\nAs with percentages, per person or per capita rates are used to level the playing field.\nThey’re often used when you need to compare two dissimilar places or events: Crimes in cities with different populations, deaths from various diseases or Gross Domestic Product across countries.\nRates also are often used with very big or very small numbers to change them into something we can understand.\nSometimes, though, a rate makes things more complicated, especially when events are rare and there is a consensus that they shouldn’t ever happen. Some examples include the 32 crashes attributed to GM’s faulty ignition switch, or the 64 deaths that the Centers for Disease Control associated with pharmacy compounding errors in 2012.\nOne rule of thumb is to use raw numbers when they are under 100, and revert to some kind of fraction or rate when they grow bigger.\n\nRates for large numbers\nA raw per-person figure is an average and should usually be used with very big numbers.\nA Gross Domestic Product of $17 trillion is hard to digest. So we reduce it to a number we can understand. If we divide it by 317 million, we get about $54,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. It doesn’t mean that each person earned $54,000 – in fact, almost half of all families earned less than that altogether at this writing. Instead, it includes all of the income that is generated by companies as well as people.\nBut the device turns an incomprehensible number into something we can picture. It also helps if we want to compare countries – it levels the playing field by adjusting for the size of the country.\n\n\nRates for small numbers - crime, death, and other rare events\nRates such as 23 per 1,000 people or something like it – are the same as percentages, but you multiply by something bigger than 100 or move the decimal place further to the right. Use these for very small numbers.\nIf 2.5 million people die in this country every year, then the percentage of people who die is a really small number: 0.789 per 100, or percent.\nA number that little is hard to digest. So experts up the ante and express the figure as 789 deaths per 100,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall numbers warning\n\n\n\nBe careful about rates based on very small numbers. One example is the number of police shootings per 100,000 people. Most police departments in the country are very small and are more likely to serve only about 5,000 people. This means that just one shooting in the department can lift them from one of the lowest rates in the nation to one of the highest. Expect rates based on very small numbers to be unstable and potentially misleading.1\n\n\n\nFiguring a rate\nStep 1: Choose your base. This is often difficult. In reporting on fatalities by make of car, should you use the number of cars on the road, the number sold, or the total miles driven each year? You’ll have to decide.\nStep 2: Divide the number you care about by the base. Choosing the numerator can also be tricky. Going back to the automobile fatality example, would you use the total number of deaths or the number of driver deaths? Take a hint using other reports you see on the topic. Experts have often come to an informal agreement about what the most telling number is.\nStep 3: Multiply by a nice round number, such as 1,000, 100,000 or 1 million.\nStep 4: Round the answer and simplify.\n\nFormula\nStep 1: Choose the base, or “total”\nStep 2: (Category / Total) = Proportion or Rate\nStep 3: Proportion x 1,000 = Rate per thousand\nStep 4: Round to zero decimal places\n\nExample\nAccording to the FBI Crime in the United States for 2012, there were 13,000 violent and property crimes in Pittsburgh out of a population of 312,000. There were 8,870 crimes in Tucson out of a population of 531,000. Figuring a rate per thousand residents lets you compare the two cities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPittsburgh\nTucson\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Base= 312,000 people\nStep 1: Base = 531,000 people\n\n\nStep 2: 13,000 crimes / 312,000 people = 0.041\nStep 2: 8,870 / 531,000 people = 0.017\n\n\nStep 3: 0.041 x 1,000 = 41 crimes per thousand\nStep 3: .017 * 1,000 = 17 crimes per thousand\n\n\n\nSo the crime rate for Pittsburgh was nearly 2 1/2 times that of Tucson that year , or 47/17 = 2.4\n\n\n\nSelecting your multiplier\n\n\n\nSome people feel that changing their multiplier from 100 to something bigger is cheating.\nAfter all, a 0.2 percent rate becomes a big number – 200 – when you change the base from 100 to 100,000!\nIn practice, though, there’s nothing magical about using a base of 100 (or percent). Instead, use the number that makes sense for the comparison you’re making.\n\nChoose a round number – 1,000, 1 million or 100,000.\nChoose the same number that the experts use: Crimes per 1,000 people, deaths per 100,000, or crashes per million miles driven, for example.\nChoose a base that will give you an easy way to express it to your readers. This is one that results in a number generally between 1 and 1,000 or so.\nTry to avoid using an outrageously large base. For instance, avoid expressing a local number in terms of 1 million people. Only a handful of cities have more than a million people.\nKeep the same base throughout your story. Don’t shift from 100,000 to 1,000 in crime statistics, for instance, when you move from murders to total crime rates.\n\nYou will often have to balance these rules of thumb against each other to come up with a compromise that allows you to write gracefully while keeping the sense of scale appropriate for the comparisons you’re making."

If you are measuring differences in time, it’s the newer number minus the older number.\nOne time to use a simple difference is when the number is understandable without any calculations. Prices of common household goods, salaries and home prices are examples of numbers that needn’t always be put into perspective using percentage changes.\nIn the end, we work in news. That means that sometimes you’ll use a raw number when it’s more newsworthy. This doesn’t necessarily mean the number is more alarming – just more meaningful.\n\nFiguring a difference:\nSubtract the older number from the newer number.\nThis is not the same as subtracting the little number from the big number.\nIf a number has fallen you get a negative number. If a number has risen you get a positive number.\nFormula\nNew – Old.\nExample An executive made $2.4 million last year.

Unfortunately, only two of them work every time. I’ll show you both because sometimes – especially when you want to compare rates – one is easier than the other.\nNote that these methods work whether or not the number is going up or going down. If the number has fallen, you’ll get a negative answer. If the number has risen, you’ll get a positive one. And it still comes out right if the increase is bigger than 100 percent.2\nIn practice, I use Method 1 when I’m working in spreadsheets because I can look at the simple difference in one column and then use it in the formula for the percentage difference.

This is the same as the percent of total above, except the old number is the base.\nStep 2: Subtract 1 from that ratio\nStep 3: Multiply by 100, or move the decimal point two places to the right.\nStep 4: Round off and simplify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: New – Old = Difference\nStep 2: Difference / Old = Decimal answer\nStep 3: Decimal x 100 = percentage difference\nStep 4: Round off.\n\n\n\n Step 1: New / Old = Ratio\nStep 2: Ratio - 1 = Decimal answer\nStep 3: Decimal x 100 = percentage difference\nStep 4: Round off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\nAn executive made $2.4 million last year. They made $2.9 million in this year.\n\n\nStep 1: Difference = 2.9 – 2.4 = 0.5\nStep 2: Difference / Original number =  0.5 / 2.4 = .208\nStep 3: Move the decimal point = 20.8%\nStep 4: Round off and simplify:  21% = 21 / 100 = about 20 / 100 = or about one-fifth.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Ratio = 2.9/2.4 = 1.208\nStep 2: Decimal answer = 1.208 - 1 = .208\nStep 3: Move the decimal point = 20.8%\nStep 4: Round off and simplify:  21% = 21 / 100 = about 20 / 100 = or about one-fifth.\n\n\nSo the executive got a raise equivalent to one-fifth of their original salary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReversing or predicting a percent change\n\n\n\nRemember that a number can grow many times, but it can only fall 100 percent to zero. This is a rough concept until you think it through. If you double a price of $20, increasing it by 100%, it’s $40. If you triple it, it’s $60. But if you reduce the $40 back to $20, it’s a 50 percent drop, to one-half the level, not a 100 percent decrease. In other words, percent changes can’t be reversed.\nThis means that the ads claiming you’ll use three times less detergent or a food contains three times less salt are wrong and impossible. What they probably mean is that it would be three times as much if you used the other brand or ate the other food, or the brand is one third as much. Here are two ways this makes a difference:\nYou need two of three numbers to reverse or predict a percent change:\n\nWhere the number started\nWhere it ended\nWhat the percent change would (or will) be\n\nAny two of those will give you what you need. It’s easiest if we use Method 2 above to get there. The example above assumes you know where it started and where it ended. Here’s how to do it if you you have either of the other two:\nWhere it starts and the percent change\nExample: You started with $100 and it grew by a total of 12%. Or, you started with $100 and it fell by a total of 12% (the percent change was -12%)\nStep 1: Convert the percent change to a ratio by moving the decimal place back : .12 (up) or -.12 (down)\nStep 2: Add 1, resulting in 1.12 (up) or .88 (down)\nStep 3: Multiply the beginning number by that amount : $100 x 1.12 = $112 (up), or $100 x .88 = $88 (down)\nWhere it ends and the total percent change\nFor example, say your house is worth $330,000, and it had appreciated by a total of 15% over the past few years. Here’s how to figure out where it started:\nStep 1: Convert the percent change to a decimal, as above: 0.15\nStep 2: Divide the current value by that amount = $330 / .15 = $287\nThis isn’t intuitive, but it differs because you’re starting from a bigger base. 15 percent of 330 isn’t the same as 15 percent of 287.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing further with percents and rates\nThere are three common problems in changes and rates you will probably encounter that aren’t part of this guide. You should get help or look it up when these situations come up: 3\n\nRelative risk: That’s the technical term for dividing two percentages. If the mortgage denial rate for Black homeowners was 10 percent, and the denial rate of white homeowners was 5 percent, it means that Black homeowners are twice as likely to be denied a loan. This can be used with both rates and with changes.\nAnnual rates: When you know that something has grown, say, 2 percent a year for 10 years, it’s not the same thing as 20 percent. You have to annualize it.\nAdjusting for inflation: Comparing values across two points in time – especially today – means putting them on the same footing. Generally, you want to convert old values to their buying power today. For example, it’s hard to compare salaries for teachers today with those 50 years ago, because our money isn’t worth as much today."

    "text": "A.4 Average and typical values\nAverages4 are just summaries. If a quote sums up an event, or an anecdote sums up a person using their actions instead of words, an average sums up a human condition of some kind – money, congestion, death or disease – in a single number.\nChoosing your average carefully or deciding there may be another number or method to sum up a situation can mean the difference between accurately and inaccurately describing your story.\nUnderstanding different kinds of “measures of central tendency” – what they tell us and what they don’t – is the first thing you learn in basic statistics classes. If an it doesn’t describe your data well, it’s not very productive to move forward into many other kinds of analysis.\nTrying to compare populations over time is particularly tricky using averages because of giant demographic shifts. Between the Baby Boom and the Millennials came what some people call the Baby Bust. Getting average spending on education, for example, across these generations is really misleading – it will boom, then bust, them boom again and no one number will describe that pattern.5\nTwo types of averages are reviewed here. Consult an introductory statistics book if your work depends on an average.\n\nThe average or mean\nA “mean” is what people mean when they say the word “average”.\nIt’s most descriptive when it summarizes numbers that don’t vary too much at either the top or bottom ends. These averages will often be misleading when they refer to items measured in dollar amount like incomes, housing costs and the like.\n\nFiguring a simple average or mean\nStep 1: Add up a list of numbers.\nStep 2: Divide the answer by the number of numbers you’ve added up.\nFormula\nStep 1: Sum of numbers\nStep 2: Sum / Count of numbers\nFor spreadsheet users: =AVERAGE(list of numbers)\nExample\nHere are six home prices on a block:\n$275,000          $1,200,000\n$275,000            $500,000\n$200,000            $395,000\n\nStep 1: 275 + 275 + 200 + 1,200 + 500 + 395 = 2,845 or $2,845,000\nStep 2: $2,845,000 / 5 = $569,000.\nSo the average home price is more than all but one on the list.\n\n\n\nThe median\nMedians are often used to summarize the value of things measured in dollars, especially home prices and incomes. They are not sensitive to one or two unusually high or low values the way the average in the previous example is.\nBut it’s harder to get a median because you need a list of all values. For example, if you know the total income of a metropolitan area and the number of people in that area, you can compute the average – or per capita income – but not the median.\nOne way to express the median is to call it the “typical” value. Another way is to say that it’s the “middle” value.\n\nFiguring a median:\nStep 1: List all of your numbers in order, beginning with the lowest and ending with the highest.\nStep 2: Count how many numbers you have and divide by two.\nStep 3: Add 0.5. If that comes out to a whole number (like 13), count up the list that many values.\nIf it’s not (like 12.5), take the average of the two numbers surrounding the number. 6\nIn other words, this is the closest you can get to the middle of the list. This is a sorting and counting job, not a calculator job.\nIn a spreadsheet, use the =MEDIAN() function.\nExample:\nStep 1:\nThe same list, but listed from lowest to highest, with an extra expensive home\n1.    $200,000\n2.    $275,000      \n3.    $275,000      \n4.    $395,000\n5.    $500,000\n6.  $1,200,000\nStep 2: 6/2 = 3\nStep 3: 3 + .5 = 3.5\nStep 4: Average the 3rd and 4th items on the list: (275 + 395) / 2 = $335,000\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the median will be more telling than the average when they’re very different as in this example. But the word “median” sounds very technical to some readers and the average encompasses all of the values in a list, so we use it when they’re not too different."

    "text": "Getting data into R (or any other program) is often among the more difficult parts of your project. This postscript goes over the common data formats you’re likely to run across in your work with R. However, R is not limited to these. You’ll often find arcane and specialized data file formats if you work with statisticians or experts in geographic analysis that can also be read in R. There is almost always a package available that will read it.\n\nTabular text data\nEvery computer can read and write plain text. Those are the characters you can type on a typewriter, with no fancy formatting or other features that require special software to ingest it. Normally, you’ll work with text data that already comes as columns and rows. They usually come in two flavors:\n\nCSV data is “comma-separated values” data, which means that a new column will be created whenever a comma is encountered. If there is a chance that there might be a comma inside a column, it will be enclosed by quote marks. This usually works OK, but there are some times when you have to be careful because there could be commas AND quotes inside a column. (A good example is a column of peoples’ names – they may be something like Smith, Johnny \"The Rat\") To overcome this, some people use:\nTSV , or tab-separated data. In this case, the tab key determines the distinction between columns, which is much rarer to find in plain text files.\n\nHere’s what a CSV might look like listing the last few presidents:\n  name, position, start_date, age_at_start_date\n  \"Biden, Joe\", President, 2021-01-20, 78\n  \"Trump, Donald\", President, 2017-01-20, 70\n  \"Obama, Barack\", President, 2009-01-20, 47\nIt looks like a mess to you, but it’s a thing of beauty to a computer.\nSome government agencies just make up a delimiter instead of a comma or tab - I’ve seen them with vertical bars (|) and tildes ~.\n\n\nNon-tabular text data\nAnother common format you’ll see passed around from computer to computer is called JSON. This stands for Javascript Object Notation, and is commonly used to pass data over the web , often to your phone or your browser.\nIt looks even worse, but it’s also a thing of beauty to a computer. The same data would look like this in JSON:\n {\"presidents\": [\n    {\"name\": \"Biden, Joe\", \"position\": \"President\", \"start_date\": \"2021-01-20\", \n       \"age_at start_date\": \"78\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Trump, Donald\", \"position\": \"President\", \"start_date\": \"2017-01-20\", \n       \"age_at start_date\": \"70\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Obama, Barack\", \"position\": \"President\", \"start_date\": \"2009-01-20\", \n       \"age_at start_date\": \"47\"}\n   ]\n  } \n    \n\n\nEvil data - PDF\nData supplied in a PDF file isn’t data at all – it’s effectively pixels placed on a page, and is intended for printing and viewing, not analyzing. Government agencies often print Excel files into PDF’s – I have no idea why, but it’s common, and it’s often difficult to convince them to do anything else regardless of the local public records law. For now, just remember that this is one file format you want to avoid if at all possible – it’s the most error-prone and difficult data to manage, even if it looks pretty.\n\n\nProprietary data formats\nExcel is one proprietary data format; Google Sheets is another. You may run into many different kinds, ranging from maps to statistical systems like SAS. R has two of its own propriety formats: .RData and .Rda, which we’ll use later. R has a package that will read almost any data – once you find it, it shouldn’t be a problem."

This is especially important for construction and similar trades that have work done on sites.\nUnder the rules, most businesses had to apply for forgiveness within about a year of getting the loans. There were two choices: Apply for forgiveness, or begin paying it back after about 10 months. As of October 2022, 98 percent of the loans given in 2020 had been forgiven, and about 85 percent of the 2021 loans had been forgiven. In SBA parlance, this means they have been “remitted” or “disbursed” to the original lending institution. The Wikipedia page on the program provides a pretty detailed discussion of the details."
