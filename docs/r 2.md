# (PART) R Study Guide {-}

# Introduction {#r-intro .unnumbered}

The following chapters lay out the fundamentals of data journalism with R. I'll be adding chapters as we want them during class. The format of these chapters varies a little from the rest of the book. Each section will begin with the key concepts and skills that are included, which I hope will make them easier to find when you need them. 

The chapters are:

* [Getting started with R](r-start.html)

* [R Markdown](r-markdown.html) - the lazy person's data diary 

* [Getting data into R](r-data-import.html) - A short introduction about how you get data in, and what it looks like. 

* [An overview of Tidyverse verbs](r-verbs.html)  -  Continuing with a basic review of the Billboard top 100 hit database. 

All of the following chapters refer to the PPP data, which is documented in the [Appendix](appendix-ppp.html)

* [Select, filter, arrange](r-verb-filter.html)

* [Aggregating with groups](r-verb-groupby.html)

* [New from old data with mutate](r-verb-mutate.html)

* [ Matchmaking with joins](r-verb-join.html)

* [R recipes](r-recipes.html)

In this set of chapters for R, the following colors mean this: 

:::{.alert .alert-info}
Blue background means that there's some extra information that you'll probably need. 
::: 

:::{.alert .alert-warning}
Yellow background means "Warning!" Something bad could happen. 
:::


:::{.alert .alert-primary}
This green background is specific instructions you should follow for class.
