# (PART) Reporting with data {.unnumbered}

# In this section  {#starter-intro .unnumbered}

This section has tipsheets, handouts and tutorials that cover the most fundamental parts of investigative reporting with data:

- [Learning to read](start-story) helps you learn from consuming others' work as a reporter rather than a bystander. 

- [Newsroom math](start-math) has some general tips on getting over your fear of math. There is a more complete guide in Appendix A

- [Defining "Data"](start-data-def) walks through what we mean in journalism when we use the word "data", which could mean almost anything to anyone. 

- [Replication and the data diary](start-data-diary) introduces the idea that all of your work should be documented, either in a separate data diary or as self-documenting programs.
