# Preface {-}

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = FALSE,
                      error=TRUE,
                      message=FALSE, 
                      warning=FALSE, 
                      echo=FALSE)

```

This online book serves as a compilation of  of handouts, websites and tutorials that I have used in my data reporting class at ASU's [Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication](cronkite.asu.edu). Some of the material will be useful in other courses or for self-study, but it is primarily aimed at the investigative journalism masters' students at Cronkite.

It covers: 

- Reporting and replication in data journalism
- Table stakes: Spreadsheets in the newsroom
- Analyzing data for stories using R and R Markdown


It doesn't cover: 

- Data visualization for publication
- Working with non-tabular data such as images, sound or document collections
- Creating news applications
- Freedom of Information and public records techniques
- Data science. This is a journalism book, not a programming or statistics book. 

A note on language: I'll use the words "read" and "write" in a generic sense. I intend them to cover the range of journalistic media, including listening, watching, and news applications or graphics.  


## Credits {-}

I'm grateful to all of the trainers, experts and collaborators who have made their training materials open to the world, and they are linked prominently throughout this book. Any errors or omissions are my own. 

This book was written in `bookdown` using `RStudio`. The complete source is [available on Github](https://github.com/cronkitedata/djtextbook). It was built using R version 4.1.2, bookdown version 0.24 using the `bs4_book` template (slightly tweaked by me, and style informed by [Stat 545](https://stat545.com) by Jenny Bryan)
