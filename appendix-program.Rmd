* No one is born knowing how to code. It takes practice 
* All programming languages have certain things in common: *variables*, *operators*, *functions* and *loops*
* They also have ways to read data, or import, from files or the internet.
* An *algorithm* is just a set of instructions carried out in order.

## Building blocks

Once you learn to program in one language, learning others is much simpler. That's because you have the basic concepts down: How to assign values to variables, how to loop through lists, or how to import data. This chapter walks through some of the more universal concepts in programming. 


### Variables  {-}

Variables are just containers with names. Variables an be simple, such as a variable that holds the value, "Sarah". Or they can be quite complex, such as a multi-level data frame containing details from a Spotify playlist. Some people call them objects.^[Technically, these are different things to the innards of the computer, but that difference isn't important to us right now.]

#. **Literals**

   The most basic kind of object is a single variable that contains a single value of a specific type:

        "Sarah"
        1.0
        TRUE
        2017-01-24

   These are called "literals", which usually include text, numeric, logical (usually true/false but sometimes yes/no or 1/0) and date or date/time. When you want to use the actual letters of some text, enclose them in quotes. When you want to use the named variable, don't enclose it in quotes.  ^[ There are two special types that we'll deal with later, but can cause a lot of headaches: `NA` values and factors. You don't have to deal with them yet.]


#. **Lists / arrays / vectors**

   Most languages have some concept of a list of items called an array, vector or dictionary. In R, you create a vector using the "c" operator, short for "combine". Once you have your items in a list or a vector, you can apply the same function across all of them or work on them in order.

      
       c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 
         creates a vector of the values 1 through 5 in R
                
    
#. **Data frames or tables**

   A data frame is a special version of a list, and is equivalent to a spreadsheet: tabular, rectangular data with columns and rows. You don't need to know much about this yet, but just understand that it will become an important part of your vocabulary.

### Operators & assignment {-}

   Operators are simple arithmetic or similar operations, like adding, subtracting, dividing and multiplying. Some common operators are:

       Arithmethic: add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), or divide (/).

       Comparison: Greater than (>) , less than (<), 
                    equal to (often == ),
                    not equal to (often !=).


   "Assignment" means pushing a value into a variable name using  "<-".  It's amazing how many different ways there are to think of this. Some might call "naming a value", others might consider it "setting a variable".  
     
      my_name <- "Sarah"
      my_value <- 1.0


### Functions {-}

A function is a set of instructions. To use a function, you use its name, followed by some parentheses. If it requires information from you, those *arguments* go inside the parentheses. 
   
If you think of it as a sentence, the function is the verb, and the arguments are the nouns. You used a function in Excel:

    =SUM(A1:A15)
    
Functions are usually categorized by the type of data element that they act upon. An example in R is the function *tolower()*, which converts a text or character variable inside the parentheses to lower case. 

Many of the functions we use are already built into R, or are in *libraries* that we borrow -- someone else has already written, tested and packaged them up for you. 

Examples include:

* importing text or Excel data
* calculating the average or sum
* counting
* finding phrases within text


### Loops {-}


   A loop is a way to repeat your instructions over and over without having to re-write them every time. They usually work by stepping through some kind of a list, like a directory of files, or by using a counter, such as every year between 2005 and 2018.

Excel and Google Sheets don't really have loops, unless you learn the more complicated programming language behind them. This is why many people move to a programming langugate -- to get the power of loops.

One type of loop commonly used in programs is a "for loop", which says, "for every one of something, follow these instructions":

Common tasks that reporters do with loops include combining annual spreadsheets from a government website or downloading and importing many files at once; and scraping web pages that require clicking into each link one by one. We'll get to this at the end of the semester.

## An algorithm to make an omelet


Algorithms are just instructions that get followed in order. If you brush your teeth the same way every morning, you can probably write out the steps as an algorithm. 

Suppose you want to make an omelet. Before you even start, you need to know at least two things: which ingredients you have on hand, and what kind of omelet you want to make.

A function or algorithm that creates an omelet might look something like this. The first row creates a function called `make_omelet()`, which requires the two pieces of information as *arguments*. Once you've made the function, you can refer to that set of instruction by its name by giving it the arguments it needs.

(All of these examples are called "pseudo-code". They won't actually work in any program, but they lay out the logic that has to be translated into the specific computer language you're using.)

    function make_omelet (ingredients_on_hand, what_kind) {

         check for necessary ingredients (are all elements of what_kind in ingredients_on_hand?)
             quit now if you don't have them all.
             return the error message

         prepare the ingredients for (what_kind)

         whisk the eggs

         melt some butter in a pan

         pour in the eggs

         add ingredients for what_kind

         flip the omelet

         remove from pan

         give me the omelet 

    }


Now, when you want to make an omelet, you can just make your list of ingredients and the kind of omelet you want, and execute the function:

Here are the ingredients I already have:

    ingredients <-
            c("butter", "eggs", "cheese", "spinach", "tomatoes")


I want a spinach and cheese omelet: 

    kind <-
            c("spinach", "cheese")


Now, use the function we created to make it using those two lists as the required arguments:

    make_omelet (ingredients, kind)
    
When you use a built-in function in R, it will show you the arguments that are both required and optional as you type.


### Open a restaurant with loops {-}

Now, you'd have to repeat this over and over if you had a restaurant. It might look like this:

      make_omelet (ingredients,kind)
      ** make a new list of ingredients left and the kind**
      make_omelet (ingredients2, kind2)
      ** make a new list...**
      make_omelet (ingredients3, kind3)
      ... and so on.

 You'd have a program hundreds of lines long -- one for each customer. Instead, you could *loop* through the customers and do the same thing:

    customers <- c("Bob", "Jamal", "Christine", "Lauren")

    for each customer in the list of customers {
      request what kind they want
      make_omelet (ingredients_on_hand, kind_this_customer_wants)
      give omelet to customer
      update your ingredients list if you ran out of something or went shopping
    }
