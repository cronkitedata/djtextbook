## Preface {-}

This book serves as a compilation of  of handouts, websites and tutorials that I have created in my data reporting class at ASU's [Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication](cronkite.asu.edu), IRE and NICAR conferences, and as an adjunct at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Some of the material will be useful in other courses or for self-study, but it is primarily aimed at the investigative journalism masters' students at Cronkite.

It covers: 

- Reporting and replication in data journalism
- Table stakes: Spreadsheets in the newsroom
- Analyzing data for stories using R and R Markdown


It doesn't cover: 

- Data visualization for publication
- Working with non-tabular data such as images, sound or document collections
- Creating news applications
- Freedom of Information and public records techniques
- Data science. This is a journalism book, not a programming or statistics book. 

A note on language: I'll use the words "read" and "write" in a generic sense. I intend them to cover the range of journalistic media, including listening, watching, and news applications or graphics.  

### Navigation

Each major section on the left can be expanded to see the chapters included. There is a table of contents for the current page at underneath that index. 

### Conventions used in this book {.unnumbered}

This book is written using a Mac desktop keyboard, meaning there may be key combinations you don't have. I'll try to keep them to a minimum. I'll try to use the convention `CMD/CTL` and `OPT/ALT` , with the part before the / for Mac users and part after the / for Windows users.
